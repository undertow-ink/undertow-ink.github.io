Their editor is going to send it to another established author (unknown to them) to complete the new creative fictional work. A short story in ten parts. Do not mention any of the authors, titles, characters, etc. from existing material. But do give names to places and characters (mix up name, and pronouns to add variation, maybe at times name by relationship- mom, uncle, etc. but don't overdo it, maybe at times nickname or shortened name but don't overdo it - mainly stick to the writing style of the authors you are emulating. In the dialog, just say "Person 1" and "Person 2". Don't write any details that identify the works they read. But be very precise and detailed about crafting this new creative work of fiction. Not wishy washy stuff. A concrete setting. Concrete characters. Concrete plot. All named. Not surface stuff. What is the essence? What is the tone? What is the symbolism. This isn't writing 101. Don't mention general writing advice. Write only things that would be helpful to an established author, but these two are creating everything about the book, the author is just translating it to their own  writing style and executing. The why for every decision. The symbolism, metaphor, allegory. Embody these authors - what do you know about their motivations and techniques given their body of existing work? Avoid overused terms like ghost, whisper, and neon. Drop the reader into the story. One example is to use dialog between the characters when they are having a conversation. Don't write something like "He told her ...". Have a dialog. In general this aligns to the rule to "Show don't tell" - adhere to the writing style of the authors - but these authors are extremely capable and they no doubt drop the reader into a world, a context, a character - the writing is the world, the character, the place, the emotions, the relationships, the conflicts, the philosophy.
