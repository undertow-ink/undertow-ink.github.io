## How It Works

This site presents unique short stories created through an innovative collaboration process.

1. Real people ("pickers") share their five favorite authors
2. A script runs repeatedly, randomly selecting a picker and their list of favorite authors
3. The script chooses two planners from that list of authors
4. Via ChatGPT the planners read and get inspired by the works of two other authors on the list
4. They collaborate to plan a story in 10 parts
5. Finally- blind to the other four authors and via ChatGPT- the remaining author writes the story in their own style following the plan

## My Goal

To create quality, innovative stories that readers love by combining:
- Human curation (your favorite authors)
- AI collaboration (planning and writing)
- Literary cross-pollination (authors inspiring each other)

## Technical Details

Built with Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Stories generated using prompts to Claude and ChatGPT- more specifically to the Anthropic and OpenAI APIs via a Python script that orchestrates the author collaboration process.
