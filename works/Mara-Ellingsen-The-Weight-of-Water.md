The Weight of Water  
by Mara Ellingsen

She arrived on the early bus, the kind that stopped for no one, not even the ghosts that lined the highway in the faint light of dawn. The windows rattled as it crossed the bridge into town, that bridge she had sworn never to see again. From her seat she could already smell it, the river with its mix of silt and rot, the faint tang of sawdust that somehow lingered decades after the mill had gone quiet. She pressed her forehead to the glass and told herself it was temporary, that she would do what needed to be done and then leave again, fast, like a thief sneaking out a back door.

The bus left her at the corner near the old diner, paint peeling, the neon sign buzzing half-dead in the gray morning. People she half-recognized stood smoking outside, their faces weathered into masks of acceptance. She could feel their eyes on her as she dragged her suitcase along the cracked sidewalk, each step a reminder that she did not belong to this place anymore, though it had never stopped belonging to her.

Her brother’s house was the same sagging structure she remembered, though smaller now, as if the years had pressed it down. He was waiting on the porch, thinner than she had pictured, his hands restless in his lap. When he smiled, it was the same crooked smile from childhood, but softer, more tentative. She felt a pull deep in her chest, a mixture of pity and resentment, love wrapped tight around a splinter of dread.

Inside, the house smelled of damp wood and unwashed dishes. The air held a heaviness that spoke of time passing without interruption, like a room sealed off and left to molder. She set her bag down and looked at him, really looked, at the way his shoulders curved inward as though protecting some fragile core. He asked if she was hungry, and she said yes, though her throat was too tight for food.

Later, she walked to the river, following the narrow dirt path that used to lead to the ferry dock. The ferry itself sat where it always had, rusted through, its ropes slack and frayed. She stood at the edge and watched the water slide by, slow and brown, carrying bits of branches and leaves downstream. The river was unchanged, indifferent to all the lives that had begun and ended on its banks.

She closed her eyes and listened. There was the low hum of insects, the distant groan of a freight train cutting through town, and beneath it all, the sound of water reshaping the land grain by grain. It made her think of all the things that erode so quietly you only notice when they are gone—trust, youth, the belief that you could escape the place that made you.

When she opened her eyes, she could see the town spread out behind her like a memory she had tried to burn but that refused to turn to ash. The sagging rooftops, the abandoned storefronts with faded hand-painted signs, the people who stayed because leaving required a kind of courage they had never been taught. She felt the weight of it settle on her shoulders, heavy but familiar.

Her brother called her name from the porch when she returned. He waved, a small, fluttering motion that felt both like welcome and plea. She thought of the land they still owned, the papers that would need signing, the meetings with men who would look at her as though she were nothing more than a problem to be solved.

That night, lying awake in the narrow bed she once shared with her sister long gone from this place, she could hear the river. It was in the walls, in the floorboards, in her own pulse. She understood, with a clarity that chilled her, that leaving had never erased it. The river ran through her as surely as blood, and no amount of distance had ever changed its course.

She imagined herself rising before dawn, walking again to the dock, watching the water in that gray hour when the world holds its breath. The heron would startle, lift itself in one sudden motion, wings beating against the quiet. And she would stand there, rooted, unable to tell if what she felt was grief or belonging, or if those two were, in the end, the same thing.

The morning came soft and pale, the kind of light that makes everything look older. She brewed weak coffee in a dented pot, the smell mingling with the dampness in the air. Her brother shuffled in wearing the same clothes as yesterday, as if changing them had become a burden too heavy to bear. He sat at the table and cradled the mug she handed him like it was fragile china. They talked around things, about the weather, about how the train had been running late all week. Neither mentioned their father’s land, though it hovered between them like an accusation neither of them wanted to voice.

After breakfast she walked through town alone, reacquainting herself with its geography as though tracing the lines of an old scar. The hardware store was still open, though half its shelves were bare. The barbershop smelled of talc and stale tobacco, the same men in the same chairs as if time had simply stopped ticking here. They nodded to her with recognition that felt more like ownership than welcome.

She passed the schoolyard, its swings creaking in the wind, and remembered the day she had decided to leave. It had not been a dramatic decision, no slammed doors or shouted words, just a quiet resolve that she could not spend her life waiting for something that would never arrive. She had left with a suitcase and a bus ticket, thinking freedom meant severing ties. But walking those streets again, she could feel the invisible threads tugging at her, reminding her that escape had never been clean.

At the edge of town she paused by the boarded-up mill. The chain-link fence sagged under the weight of rust, weeds growing thick around its base. She ran her hand along the cold metal and thought of her father, the way his clothes had always smelled of pine and sweat when he came home from work. He had believed in permanence, in land and labor and legacy. She had believed in leaving. Neither of them had been right.

By the time she returned to the house, her brother was asleep on the porch swing, his face slack in a way that made him look almost childlike. She sat beside him and listened to the rhythmic squeak of the chains as the swing moved in the breeze. For a moment she could almost pretend there was still time to fix everything, that their lives had not already been shaped by choices made too long ago to undo.

The sound of the river reached her even there, a low constant murmur that refused to be ignored. It felt like a summons, though to what she could not yet name.

The sky was heavy with the promise of rain when she woke. The air held that metallic edge that always came before a storm, and she thought of the way the sawdust used to cling to her father’s boots, the way it would lift in a golden cloud whenever the mill floor shook. She dressed quickly, pulling on her old work shirt from a box in the closet, surprised at how easily her hands remembered the motion of tying the sleeves.

Her brother was in the kitchen, leaning against the counter, reading the yellowed newspaper as if the world outside had not long since forgotten this town. He asked if she wanted to see the land today. She nodded, though the thought of it twisted in her gut. The fields had lain fallow since their father’s death, too far gone for farming now, just a stretch of earth dotted with stubborn weeds and broken fence posts.

They walked the path together, the silence between them punctuated by the crunch of gravel and the occasional call of a crow. The land opened up like a wound, wide and empty, the river curving along its edge as though guarding it. She could see where the fence had collapsed, where the barn roof had caved in under the weight of time and weather. Nothing here looked salvageable.

Her brother rested against a fence post, breathing harder than he should have. She felt the urge to tell him to sit, to conserve his strength, but she said nothing. He stared out at the fields as if he could still see what used to be there—the rows of pine, the stacks of lumber, the men working in the heat with their shirts darkened by sweat.

“This place doesn’t want us anymore,” she said finally.

He shook his head slowly. “It doesn’t know what it wants. It just waits.”

They stood there until the first drops of rain began to fall, cold and fat against their skin. She closed her eyes and inhaled, the smell of wet earth and ghosted sawdust filling her chest. For a moment it felt as if the past were pressing up through the ground, demanding to be acknowledged, refusing to be buried.

On the walk back, the rain grew heavier. By the time they reached the porch, they were both soaked through. Her brother laughed softly, a sound so rare it startled her. It was the laugh of someone who had surrendered to the moment because fighting it had become too exhausting. She found herself smiling, not because there was joy in it, but because it was the only response that made sense.

The rain stayed for two days, steady and unrelenting, turning the yard to mud and the river to a rushing brown vein that carried entire branches downstream. The house felt smaller in the damp, the air heavy with the scent of mildew and wet wood. She spent most of those hours watching her brother sleep on the couch, the quilt pulled to his chin, his face pale in the gray light that leaked through the curtains.

When he woke, they tried to make plans, but every conversation ended in the same stalemate. Selling the land would mean surrendering what little their father had left them. Keeping it would mean debts they couldn’t afford. He spoke of legacy, of roots, of how the town might still remember their name if they stayed. She heard only the word stay, sharp and immovable as a stone in her shoe.

In the evenings she walked down to the river, umbrella in hand, boots sinking into the soft ground. The ferry sat half-submerged now, its hull dark with moss, ropes twisted like veins across the dock. She thought of how once it had carried people across in minutes, a bridge of possibility that had been abandoned when the bridge itself was built. The ferry’s obsolescence felt like an accusation, a reminder of how quickly usefulness becomes memory.

On the second night, she found herself standing at the edge of the water long after the rain had soaked her through. She thought of the city she had made her home, the life she had cobbled together there with grit and luck. It seemed impossibly far away, as if she had dreamed it. Here, the past was louder than the future. It seeped into her bones.

When she returned to the house, her brother was awake, sitting up with a blanket draped over his shoulders. He looked smaller somehow, as if each day had been stealing pieces of him. She sat beside him and rested her hand on his, feeling the slight tremor in his fingers. He smiled weakly and said, “You’re staying longer than you thought.”

She didn’t answer. There was no right answer. The silence that followed felt heavier than any words could have been.

The rain finally broke, leaving the air raw and clean, the ground dark with saturation. She woke to the sound of the train passing through, its whistle low and mournful, and for a moment she imagined it was calling her name. Her brother was already awake, sitting at the table with a stack of unpaid bills spread out before him. He looked at her as though bracing for a fight, but all she did was pour coffee and sit down across from him.

They went through the bills together in silence, the columns of numbers stark and undeniable. The hospital visits had been more frequent than he admitted, and the medication alone was enough to keep them drowning. She wanted to be angry at him for hiding it, but anger felt like a luxury they couldn’t afford. Instead she felt that creeping mix of guilt and inevitability, as if her presence had pulled the truth into the open simply by existing.

Later they drove to the courthouse, the truck’s engine groaning as if resentful of the journey. The town looked different from behind the windshield, its edges blurred by speed, but the faces on the sidewalks still turned toward them with the same quiet scrutiny. At the clerk’s office, they sat in metal chairs while a bored woman in a floral blouse explained the paperwork they would need to transfer the land. Every sentence felt like a verdict, final and unyielding.

Her brother signed first, his hand trembling just slightly. She hesitated, pen hovering over the line, as if some last-minute miracle might intervene. When she finally pressed the ink to the page, it felt less like a signature and more like a betrayal—of her father, of the child she had been, of the belief that leaving had spared her from this place’s gravity.

On the drive back, they didn’t speak. The road curved along the river, swollen and restless, carrying away pieces of the bank as if erasing what had once been fixed. She thought of how nothing truly held, how everything shifted whether you wanted it to or not.

When they pulled into the driveway, her brother stayed in the truck a moment longer, staring at the house. His expression was unreadable, some mix of exhaustion and relief, but when he finally climbed out he looked lighter, as though surrender had freed him in a way she could not yet understand.

The days after the signing blurred together, each one a muted echo of the last. She spent her mornings making simple meals, coaxing her brother to eat when his appetite faltered, watching the color drain slowly from his face. In the afternoons she sorted through the house, opening drawers that had not been touched in years, finding receipts yellowed to illegibility, photographs with corners curling, letters in her father’s handwriting that read like messages sent from another world.

The townspeople began to stop by, uninvited but expected, bearing pies and casseroles wrapped in foil. Their conversations were always the same—nostalgia dressed as kindness, memories of her father told with a reverence that felt both comforting and suffocating. They spoke as though the land had been a covenant and not a burden, as though she had not just severed something they believed should have lasted forever.

One evening she stepped outside after everyone had gone. The sun was sinking, staining the river orange, and for a fleeting moment the world looked almost beautiful. She could hear the freight train in the distance, its rhythm steady and unyielding, and she wondered if anyone in the cars had ever thought about this town, if they even knew it existed.

Her brother joined her on the porch, wrapped in a blanket despite the warmth of the evening. He leaned against the railing and said, “I keep dreaming of the ferry running again. I’m on it, going somewhere, but I never see where it lands.”

She wanted to tell him dreams like that meant nothing, but instead she nodded. She had begun to dream of it too—the ferry gliding across water that was impossibly calm, carrying her somewhere unnamed. Always, she woke before it reached the other side.

That night, lying in the narrow bed, she felt the house breathing around her, the walls creaking in their slow decay. She imagined the ferry rusting further each hour, ropes fraying thread by thread. The town felt alive in a way that had nothing to do with hope, only persistence. It would endure, with or without her.

The heat returned with a vengeance, thick and unmoving, as if the air itself had given up on circulation. She spent the morning washing sheets, the damp fabric clinging to her arms as she carried it outside to hang on the line. The simple act felt both grounding and futile, a small gesture of care in a place that resisted change. Her brother sat on the porch with a glass of water he barely touched, his eyes following her movements like he was memorizing them.

That afternoon the doctor came by, a woman younger than she expected, with a kind face that revealed nothing. They spoke in the kitchen while her brother dozed in the next room. The doctor’s words were clinical, careful, but their meaning was not: his condition was worsening, there would be harder days ahead. She nodded through it, each sentence hitting like a quiet blow.

When the doctor left, she stood in the doorway watching the dust rise from the tires as the car disappeared down the road. The house seemed even smaller after that, as though the walls were drawing closer. She found her brother awake, looking at her as if he already knew what had been said.

He asked her to walk to the river with him. They went slowly, his steps halting but determined, until they reached the dock where the ferry lay sunken deeper in the water than before. They sat on the edge with their feet dangling, saying nothing. The river moved beneath them, steady and unbothered, carrying away bits of debris that had been loosened by the recent storms.

She wanted to tell him she was sorry—sorry for leaving, sorry for coming back too late, sorry for everything in between—but the words felt meaningless. Instead she placed her hand over his, and for a while that was enough. The sky darkened, and the heron rose suddenly from the reeds, its wings slicing the air in one clean motion. They both watched it until it was gone.

The next morning the house smelled faintly of rain again, though the sky was clear. She woke to find her brother already dressed, sitting at the table with an envelope in front of him. Inside were documents he had gathered—insurance papers, lists of accounts, instructions written in his unsteady hand. He slid them toward her without a word. She stared at them for a long moment before tucking them back into the envelope, as if refusing to read them could undo the reason they existed.

They spent the afternoon in the yard, trimming back weeds along the fence line, the work slow and uneven. Her brother tired quickly, but he refused to stop. She let him continue, though each movement seemed to drain him further. When he finally collapsed into a chair, sweat darkening his collar, she brought him water and held the glass while he drank.

Later, they sat on the porch as the sun dropped low, the air turning gold. The quiet between them felt different now—not the avoidance of earlier days, but the fragile kind that forms when there is nothing left to hide.

“I used to think leaving would fix everything,” she said, surprising herself with the admission.

Her brother smiled faintly. “And did it?”

She didn’t answer. Instead, she looked toward the river, its surface glinting in the fading light. The ferry was barely visible from where they sat, just a shadow at the edge of sight, but she could feel its presence all the same. It had become the town’s truest landmark—not for what it was, but for what it no longer did.

When darkness fell, she helped him inside, guiding him as he leaned heavily on her arm. The effort of standing, of breathing, seemed to take everything he had left. She settled him onto the couch, pulled the blanket over him, and sat nearby until his eyes closed. Even then, she stayed awake, listening to the faint, steady sound of the river moving through the night.

By morning his fever had risen. She could feel the heat radiating off him as she pressed a cool cloth to his forehead, his eyes half-open but unfocused. He mumbled things she couldn’t quite catch, fragments of memories or dreams, her name threaded through them like a refrain. She stayed close, afraid that stepping away would mean losing something she could never get back.

The doctor came quickly this time, her expression grave but unsurprised. She adjusted medications, left instructions that felt both urgent and futile, and touched her shoulder briefly before leaving. The silence that followed was immense, broken only by the shallow rhythm of his breathing.

She spent the rest of the day tending to him in small ways—sips of water, damp towels, whispered reassurances she wasn’t sure he could hear. As evening fell, she opened the windows to let in the cool air from the river. The smell of wet earth and pine drifted through the room, as if the outside world wanted to remind her it still existed.

At dusk she stepped outside for just a moment, the sky streaked with violet and orange. The ferry was a darker silhouette now, half-swallowed by the water. The river looked swollen, restless, as though it had grown impatient with its own constant motion.

When she returned inside, her brother’s eyes were open, clearer for a fleeting moment. He reached for her hand, his fingers weak but insistent. “Don’t stay because of me,” he said, his voice barely more than breath.

She wanted to tell him she didn’t know what she would do. That every choice felt like a loss she hadn’t yet learned how to bear. But instead she just held his hand tighter, as though that single act might be enough to keep him here a little longer.

He died just before dawn, the room still and dim, the river’s murmur the only sound. She sat with him long after his breathing stopped, her hand on his cooling skin, as if refusing to acknowledge what had already happened might hold time in place. Outside, the first light broke through the trees, soft and pale, and the world moved on without hesitation.

When the men from the funeral home came, she stepped aside, watching as they carried him away. The house felt cavernous once he was gone, every room echoing with absence. She wandered through it aimlessly, touching the backs of chairs, the edges of doorframes, as though the worn wood could answer her unspoken questions.

By afternoon she stood at the river again. The ferry was lower in the water now, its rusted frame giving way to the current. She imagined her brother on it, gliding silently to some unseen shore. The thought was neither comforting nor unbearable; it simply was.

She stayed there until the sun began to set, the sky streaked with the colors of endings. She thought of the city waiting for her, of the life she could return to, of the emptiness that would follow her either way. There was no revelation, no sudden clarity. Only the knowledge that whichever path she chose would take something from her that she could never reclaim.

When she finally turned back toward the house, the sound of the freight train carried across the water, low and distant. She closed her eyes and let it pass through her, feeling its weight like a reminder, like a promise, like the echo of a decision she had not yet made.
