Matthias Rosenkranz - The Threshold of the Possible

The community that emerges from the ruins of development is not a return to what was, but the revelation of what has always been possible—a form-of-life that exists in the suspension between the singular and the common, where the erosion of traditional bonds becomes the very condition for genuine belonging. This is the paradox that haunts our age: only in witnessing the destruction of ancient patterns of reciprocity can we glimpse the whatever being that was always latent within them, the pure potentiality that industrial modernity both reveals and forecloses in the same gesture.

In a valley where diesel generators arrived last winter, replacing the communal water mills that had ground barley for eight centuries, something essential becomes visible precisely at the moment of its disappearance. The mills had never been merely instruments for processing grain. They were nodes in an elaborate web of mutual obligation—families took turns maintaining the wooden channels, shared the labor of repairs, knew whose harvest would be ground on which days according to patterns as intricate as kinship itself. The generators, by contrast, require only money and fuel. They hum in private courtyards, each household now sovereign in its isolation.

Yet what manifests in this transformation is not simply loss. The young woman who once would have spent her mornings at the mill now sits in the new internet café, video-chatting with cousins in the capital. She exists in a strange temporality—no longer fully embedded in the cyclical time of agricultural seasons, not yet absorbed into the linear time of wage labor. In this suspension, she embodies a form of being that philosophy has struggled to name: neither the substantial identity of traditional community nor the atomic individuality of modern society, but something more fragile and more radical—a singularity without identity, communicating nothing but its own communicability.

The development experts who installed the generators speak of efficiency, of time saved, of increased productivity. They tabulate hours no longer "wasted" in communal labor, calculate the monetary value of freed time. But their measurements cannot capture what becomes possible in the space between the old and the new—the potential for a community that would be neither the organic wholeness of tradition nor the contractual association of modernity, but what Aristotle glimpsed and abandoned: a being-with that has no essence, no predetermined function, no identity to preserve or project.

This potentiality reveals itself most clearly in moments of breakdown. When the fuel shipment fails to arrive, when the generators fall silent, the village does not simply revert to its former state. Instead, new patterns emerge—temporary, improvised, strangely beautiful. Neighbors who had not spoken since the mills closed find themselves sharing battery power, negotiating usage, inventing protocols that belong neither to tradition nor to modernity. In these liminal moments, we see neither nostalgic return nor progressive development, but the shimmer of what Giorgio called "the coming community"—a being-together that is always arriving, never arrived.

The anthropologists document what they call "cultural loss," cataloging disappeared practices like extinct species. The economists measure "development indicators," tracking the village's integration into global markets. Both miss what is most essential: that in the very dissolution of traditional forms, something unprecedented becomes thinkable. Not the restoration of the past, not the fulfillment of progress, but a form of human existence that would finally correspond to our true condition—beings who belong without belonging, who share nothing but the fact of sharing itself.

In the high pastures, where satellite dishes now puncture the skyline alongside prayer flags, the herders practice a new kind of transhumance. They move between worlds as they once moved between seasonal grazing grounds, carrying smartphones and wool spindles, negotiating futures markets while maintaining gift economies. They are not hybrid beings, caught between two cultures, but exemplars of a more fundamental condition—the whatever being that we all are, suspended between essence and existence, particular and universal, communication and incommunicability.

The tragedy is not that development destroys traditional communities—this destruction is itself ambiguous, containing within it both catastrophe and possibility. The tragedy is that in place of the old essential communities, we are offered only the false community of the market, the empty belonging of consumer identity, the managed inclusion of development programs. These new forms of pseudo-community are more totalizing than any traditional bond, because they claim to include everyone while reducing all differences to mere market preferences, all singularities to target demographics.

What would it mean to inhabit the threshold itself, to remain in the space between the lost community and the false community? In certain moments—a shared meal during a power outage, a spontaneous gathering when the internet fails, a conversation that begins in the local language and shifts imperceptibly into a creole of tradition and modernity—we catch glimpses of this threshold existence. Here, in the suspension of both progress and nostalgia, appears the faint outline of a community that would need neither roots nor routes, neither identity nor development, but would consist simply in our being-together as the beings that we are—finite, exposed, without refuge in either tradition or future.

The mountain village, transformed by generators and abandoned by its youth, is not a case study in cultural preservation or economic development. It is a laboratory of potentiality, a site where the most ancient human questions—how to live together, how to share existence, how to be with others—are posed anew in the wreckage of all previous answers. In the hum of generators and the silence of stopped mills, in the glow of phone screens and the shadows of empty houses, we find not loss or gain but the perpetual opening of the possible.

This is what the collaboration of wisdom traditions and critical philosophy must think today: not how to preserve communities or develop them, but how to remain faithful to the community that is always coming, always potential, always more fragile and more powerful than any of its actualizations. In the end, what links the shepherd checking commodity prices on his phone and the philosopher writing of whatever being is not globalization or theory, but the shared condition of existing in the mode of possibility—exposed to a common that has no content, a belonging that possesses nothing, a being-with that is nothing other than existence itself.

The threshold is not a place of transition but our permanent home. We have always lived here, between the village and the world, between the singular and the universal, between communication and silence. Development pretends to move us across this threshold, to deliver us from tradition to modernity. But there is no other side, no arrival, no final community. There is only this perpetual opening, this endless potential, this being-together that precedes and exceeds all communities, all developments, all attempts to capture it in identity or progress.

In recognizing this, we neither mourn the past nor embrace the future. We simply remain where we are, where we have always been—on the threshold of the possible, in the community that is always coming, among beings who share nothing but their existence, who communicate nothing but their communicability, who belong nowhere but in this very exposure to one another. This is not a consolation but a task, not a philosophy but a form-of-life, not a solution but the patient habitation of the problem that we ourselves are.
