Krasznahorkai & Canetti - The Procession of the Forgotten

The crowd had been gathering since before dawn, though no one could say precisely when the first figure had appeared in the square, nor could anyone explain what invisible summons had drawn them there, what wordless command had pulled them from their beds and their kitchens and their factory floors, because the truth was that each person believed themselves to be following someone else, believed that surely the person ahead of them knew the purpose of this gathering, knew the destination of this slow-moving mass that had begun to flow through the streets like a thick, dark river of bodies, and so they followed, and in following became part of the thing itself, became indistinguishable from the whole, their individual reasons for being there—curiosity, fear, hope, or simple animal magnetism—dissolved into the greater purpose of movement itself, which was no purpose at all but merely the ancient imperative of the pack, the herd, the swarm.

They moved with the peculiar rhythm of crowds, that stuttering, surging gait that resembles nothing so much as the peristaltic motion of some enormous digestive system, processing human bodies instead of food, breaking them down into their constituent parts—not flesh and bone but something more fundamental: the need to belong, the terror of isolation, the ecstatic surrender of the self to something larger, and as they moved, pressed together in the narrow streets where the morning light had not yet penetrated, where the shadows still clung to the walls like black moss, they began to generate their own heat, their own weather system, breath mingling with breath until a visible cloud rose above them, a ghost-crowd floating over the real one, mimicking its movements.

The command to stop, when it came, was not a command at all but rather a collective exhaustion, a point at which the crowd's own weight became too much to bear, and they found themselves in a vast empty lot at the edge of the city where the abandoned factories stood like broken teeth against the gray sky, and here they waited, though for what they could not say, because waiting itself had become the activity, the purpose, the meaning, and in this waiting they discovered the terrible patience of crowds, that capacity to endure without understanding, to persist without hope, to remain without reason.

Hours passed, or perhaps minutes—time moves differently in crowds, becomes thick and viscous, loses its normal flow—and still they waited, packed together yet each fundamentally alone, each carrying their own private burden of expectation or dread, and it was then that someone, impossible to say who, began to speak, not in words but in a low humming that spread through the crowd like a contagion, each person taking up the sound without conscious decision, until the entire mass was vibrating with this wordless voice, this expression of something too ancient and too terrible to be named, and the humming grew louder, more insistent, began to take on a rhythm that matched the beating of ten thousand hearts, twenty thousand lungs expanding and contracting in unison.

What they were becoming in that moment was not a crowd but something more primitive and more sophisticated: a single organism with ten thousand eyes, ten thousand mouths, a creature born from the marriage of individual terror and collective power, and as the humming reached its crescendo, as the sound became almost unbearable in its intensity, they began to move again, not forward this time but in a slow, turning spiral, each person following the one before them, creating a whirlpool of bodies that drew everything into its center, where nothing existed but pressure and heat and the smell of humanity compressed beyond all reasonable limits.

The authorities, when they arrived, found not a riot but something far more disturbing: perfect order, perfect compliance, a crowd that had transcended the need for leadership or direction, that had become its own authority, its own government, its own nation-state existing within the boundaries of that abandoned lot, and the police, trained to disperse violence, found themselves helpless before this display of pure being, this demonstration of crowd-essence that required neither purpose nor destination, neither beginning nor end, but simply was, in the same way that mountains are, or oceans, or the slow decay of all things under the indifferent gaze of time.

As the sun reached its zenith, casting no shadows in that place where shadows had been banished by the sheer density of human presence, something changed in the crowd's disposition, a shift so subtle that no individual could have detected it, yet instantly communicated through the entire mass: the recognition that they had accomplished what they came to accomplish, though none could say what that was, and slowly, with the same mysterious coordination that had brought them together, they began to disperse, flowing back through the streets in reverse, each person peeling away at precisely the right moment to return to their abandoned bed, their cold kitchen, their silent factory floor, carrying with them no memory of words spoken or deeds done, only the lingering sensation of having been part of something immense and terrible and absolutely necessary.

In the days that followed, the authorities would investigate, would question, would analyze, but would find nothing, because there was nothing to find except the truth that crowds create their own reality, their own logic, their own necessity, and that sometimes, in certain conditions of light and pressure and accumulated human longing, they spontaneously generate from the raw material of individual lives something that transcends comprehension: not a mob, not a revolution, not a celebration, but simply the pure expression of what it means to be many rather than one, to surrender the terrible burden of selfhood to the ancient comfort of the mass, where all questions are answered by the simple fact of presence, where all doubts dissolve in the heat of bodies pressed together, where the only meaning is the meaning created by proximity, by breath on breath, by the shared recognition that we are all, in the end, waiting for something we cannot name, moving toward something we cannot see, following someone who does not exist except in our collective imagination of purpose.

And in the abandoned lot where they had gathered, where the ground was still compressed from the weight of ten thousand bodies, where the air still held some trace of their collective breath, nothing remained but a faint circular pattern in the dust, like the fossil record of some ancient ritual whose purpose had been forgotten long before the first human eye opened to the mystery of being alive, being together, being crowd.
