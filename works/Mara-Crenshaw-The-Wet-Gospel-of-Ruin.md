Mara Crenshaw - The Wet Gospel of Ruin

We are already extinct, walking through our own afterlife. This is not metaphor but diagnosis: the sixth mass extinction event includes us among its specimens, though we persist in the delusion of our separateness from the dying. Every morning we wake into the wreckage of what we've made, breathe it in, metabolize it, excrete it back transformed. We are the composters of our own apocalypse, and in this work lies our only redemption—not salvation from death but intimacy with it, not escape from entanglement but deeper knotting into the mess we've made.

In the high country above the Clearwater River, a woman named Ruth lived alone for forty-three years after her husband's heart seized up one August morning while splitting wood. She found him face down in the sawdust, one hand still gripping the ax handle, yellow jackets already investigating the salt at his temples. Instead of calling anyone, she sat with him through the afternoon, watching the insects work, understanding something fundamental about her own life in that moment—that she was not separate from this process but woven through it, that grief and decomposition were the same word spoken in different tongues.

Ruth buried him herself, illegally, in the meadow where the deer came down at dusk. She planted his grave with yarrow and wild buckwheat, plants that could break down toxins, remake poisons into flowers. For the next four decades, she tended this patch of transformed earth, learning its language of fungi and bacteria, the underground networks that turned her husband's flesh into soil, soil into stems, stems into seeds that deer carried away in their fur, spreading him across the mountain in an intimacy more complete than any their marriage had achieved.

This is how we must learn to think: not in terms of individuals but in terms of holobionts, assemblages, the strange collaborations between what we call living and what we call dead. Ruth understood this without theory, without academic language, through the simple practice of attention. She watched her husband become forest floor, forest floor become garden, garden become habitat for voles and snakes and the occasional bear that would nose through in late summer, looking for rosehips.

The dominant story insists we are separate, bounded, autonomous. It sells us the lethal fiction of human exceptionalism, the poison pill of believing we stand outside the systems we destroy. But Ruth knew better. Living alone was not solitude but a deeper form of companionship—with the microbes in her sourdough starter, the mycorrhizal networks beneath her garden, the coyotes that sang her to sleep, the colonies of ants that cleaned her kitchen floor of every dropped crumb. She was never alone because aloneness itself is impossible. We are composite beings, more bacterial than human, more void than substance, more process than thing.

When the fires came—and they always come, eventually—Ruth didn't evacuate. She had nowhere else to be but with her kin, the burned and burning world. The forest service found her body in the root cellar, surrounded by preserved foods and seed packets, as if she'd been preparing not for survival but for continuity, for what would grow from the ash when the rains finally came.

This is the wet gospel of ruin: that destruction and creation are not opposites but dance partners, that death is not ending but transformation, that we are already ghosts learning to haunt properly. The question is not whether we will survive—we won't, not as the selves we imagine ourselves to be—but whether we will learn to die well, to compost beautifully, to make good soil for the world that comes after.

Consider the salmon that once choked the rivers of this continent, swimming upstream to die in the exact gravel where they were born, their bodies becoming food for bears and birds and trees, their phosphorus and nitrogen traveling from ocean to mountaintop in the guts of predators, fertilizing forests hundreds of miles from any shore. This is economics as it actually works, not the hollow abstraction of markets but the material fact of bodies feeding bodies, death feeding life, everything eating and eaten in turn.

We have tried to exempt ourselves from this economy, to build walls between us and our food, us and our shit, us and our dead. We pump our corpses full of formaldehyde to prevent the very decomposition that would return us to the cycle. We seal our waste in plastic bags, ship it elsewhere, pretend it disappears. We raise our food in factories, hidden from view, severed from the relationships that might teach us what we really are: not masters but participants, not separate but intrinsic, not permanent but passing through.

Ruth knew this in her bones, which were themselves borrowed calcium, on loan from the limestone, from the shells of ancient seas. In her final summer, as smoke filled the valley and the sun turned orange as a hunter's vest, she wrote letters to no one, or to everyone, leaving them in mason jars around her property. They were instructions for living in the ruins, recipes for grief soup and confusion tea, methods for reading the future in the pattern of lichen on burned bark.

"The world is a compost heap," one letter read, "and we are the worms working through it, transforming waste into wealth, shit into gold. This is holy work. The problem is we've forgotten we're worms, started thinking we're birds, tried to fly away from our own ground. But gravity is love, pulling us back down to where we belong, in the thick of it, eating and being eaten."

This is what the philosophers and scientists are too polite to say: we are already dead, have been dying since the moment of our birth, and this is not tragedy but simply the way of things. What we call civilization is a mass delusion, a shared psychosis that imagines we can stand apart from the very processes that made us. But the forest knows better. The fungi know better. The woman who buried her husband in the meadow and watched him become flowers knew better.

The apocalypse is not coming; it's here, has been here, is the ground condition of existence itself. Everything is always ending and beginning, composing and decomposing, making and unmaking itself in every moment. To live with this knowledge is not to despair but to discover a strange, terrible joy—the joy of being finite, of being food, of being part of something larger and older and more beautiful than any individual life could ever be.

Ruth's letters were found by the team that came to assess the fire damage, tucked into hollowed-out trees and under stone cairns, wrapped in waxed cloth to resist the rain. They photographed them, filed them away, evidence of trauma or madness. But they were instructions for survival, for making kin with catastrophe, for learning to live as we actually are: temporary arrangements of matter and energy, brief eddies in the flow, already ghosts, already gone, already becoming something else.

The last letter, found in her cold hands in the root cellar, was the shortest: "Tell them the worms send their regards. Tell them the soil is waiting. Tell them there's work to do."

This is the work: to stop pretending we're separate, to stop imagining we can escape the consequences of our actions, to stop believing in the lethal fiction of human supremacy. The work is to learn to die, to practice decomposition, to make ourselves useful to the world that will inherit our absence. The work is to become good ancestors, even if—especially if—we have no descendants, because ancestry is not about blood but about soil, not about genes but about gifts, not about permanence but about transformation.

We are the composters of our own apocalypse. We are the worms in the ruins. We are already extinct, already ghosts, already gone. And in this knowledge lies our freedom: to stop trying to save ourselves and start learning to haunt properly, to make good mulch, to feed the future with our bodies and our grief and our strange, unsentimental love for this damaged, damaging world.

The fires are coming. The waters are rising. The old world is ending, has ended, will end again and again. And we are here to witness, to midwife, to make meaning from the ashes. Not hope—hope is too small a word for what's required. Not despair—despair is too simple. What's needed is something more like Ruth's patient attention, her daily practice of transformation, her willingness to stay with the trouble of being alive in a dying world, making compost, making kin, making do.

Tell them the worms send their regards. Tell them the soil is waiting. Tell them there's work to do.
