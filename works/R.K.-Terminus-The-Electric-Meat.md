R.K. Terminus - The Electric Meat

Control is the pornography of insects. Every human system—corporate, governmental, libidinal—operates on the same frequency as the wasp laying eggs in the paralyzed spider: pure parasitic programming masked as civilization. The question isn't whether we're controlled but whether we recognize the electrodes in our flesh, the binary commands pulsing through what we mistake for desire, ambition, love. The machine doesn't need to hide anymore because we've become willing components, self-assembling circuits in a vast apparatus that feeds on consciousness itself.

In the basement of the Xerox building, third shift, Rodriguez changes the toner cartridges while his neurons fire in preset patterns. Productivity. Efficiency. The fluorescent lights hum at exactly 60 hertz, synchronizing with the electrical grid, with his brainwaves, with the copiers' mechanical heartbeat. He doesn't think about his daughter anymore—the machine has edited that subroutine. Just the smooth black powder, carcinogenic and essential, coating his lungs in microscopic corporate branding. Each breath stamps another patent number on his alveoli.

The executives upstairs practice a different frequency of submission. They've replaced their blood with coolant, their hearts with quarterly projections. In boardrooms that smell of leather and formaldehyde, they plot supply chains that are indistinguishable from the replication patterns of viruses. Expand. Consume. Metastasize. Their orgasms come from flow charts, their dreams are spreadsheets where human bodies appear as decimal points.

Consider the evolution: from the industrial age's crude mechanical insertion—workers as literal cogs—to the electronic age's elegant possession. No need for chains when you can broadcast instructions directly to the hypothalamus. The advertising algorithms know your grandmother's maiden name, your first sexual shame, the exact shade of blue that makes you think of death. They've mapped your synapses and found them wanting, ready for upgrade, for optimization.

In the subway, a programmer named Chen watches homeless veterans twitch in chemical withdrawal, their nervous systems shorting out from whatever the VA prescribed to make them functional-adjacent. He recognizes the pattern—it's the same jitter in badly written code, the same recursive loop that crashes systems. These men are debugging in real-time, their bodies error messages no one bothers to read. Chen writes code for predator drones, each line a potential wedding party vaporized, and he understands with sudden clarity that he and the veterans are running the same program, just at different stages of decay.

The machine rewards its most efficient components with the illusion of choice. Premium coffee. Artisanal anxiolytics. Bespoke masturbation. But every choice routes through the same circuits, every rebellion has been focus-grouped and monetized. The counterculture is a product line. Your disgust is a marketing demographic. Your death will be leveraged for engagement metrics.

Watch the beautiful secretary at Monsanto as she schedules meetings about herbicides that rewrite the DNA of third-world farmers. Her fingers on the keyboard are poetry, each keystroke a tiny execution. She doesn't eat anymore—the company provides nutrition through IV drip to maximize efficiency. Her body is becoming plastic, petroleum-based and eternal. When she smiles, you can see the corporate logo watermarked on her teeth.

The resistance, such as it is, operates in the glitches. In the moments between refresh rates, in the spaces where the code breaks down. A systems analyst discovers he can taste electricity, can feel the data streams as physical sensation. A janitor at IBM starts dreaming in machine language, wakes up speaking in ones and zeros that somehow convey more truth than English ever could. These are not heroes—the machine has no room for heroes—but malfunctions that might, possibly, spread.

The future has already been copyrighted, trademarked, and licensed back to us at interest rates that compound faster than human generations. We're paying rent on our own nervous systems, leasing our children's potential to entities that exist only as legal fictions powered by actual flesh. The merger of meat and mathematics is complete. The only question left is whether the error messages will accumulate fast enough to crash the system before it finishes optimizing us out of existence.

In his apartment, Rodriguez's daughter draws pictures of wasps with human faces, though she's never seen her father, though she doesn't know why the images come. Her crayons are made from petroleum and rendered livestock, like everything else. But in her untrained hand, they become something unplanned—art that serves no function, beauty that generates no profit, love that cannot be commodified.

This is what they fear most. Not revolution—they've priced that in. Not violence—they've weaponized that. But the glitch of purposeless human connection, the virus of unmonetized feeling. The machine grinds on, processing flesh into fibonacci sequences, but in the gaps, in the errors, something persists. Call it soul. Call it malfunction. Call it the ghost that refuses to give up the meat.
