Adrienne Kohl - The Architecture of Encounter

The most dangerous lie we tell ourselves is that innovation happens in isolation—in sterile laboratories, corporate boardrooms, and policy institutes scrubbed clean of human contact. The truth is messier: every breakthrough that has ever mattered emerged from spaces where bodies collide, where conversations spill into one another, where the boundaries between public and private dissolve into something electric and unpredictable. The state that understands this—that builds for collision rather than separation—is the only state capable of shaping a future worth inhabiting.

Consider the death of a city square. Not its physical demolition, though that often follows, but the moment when its purpose shifts from encounter to mere transit. Where once strangers paused, argued, flirted, exchanged newspapers and knowing glances, now they hurry through, eyes forward, bodies armored against contact. The square still exists on the map, but its social function has been amputated. This is not urban evolution; it is managed decline dressed up as efficiency.

I think of the old terminal at Gare du Nord before its renovation—that glorious, chaotic mixing chamber where African immigrants sold phone cards next to Romanian flower vendors, where businessmen stepped over sleeping backpackers, where the smell of merguez mixed with diesel fumes and expensive perfume. The renovation promised "improved passenger flow" and "enhanced security." What it delivered was a shopping mall with train tracks, every surface monetized, every interaction mediated by commercial transaction. The state spent €600 million to transform a functional ecosystem of human exchange into a non-place, and called it progress.

But the pornographic theaters that once lined the boulevard nearby tell a different story about public investment and social value. Before you recoil at the comparison, consider: these spaces, however marginalized, created what the renovated station destroyed—zones of genuine encounter across class lines. The married businessman from Neuilly-sur-Seine sat next to the Algerian construction worker. They didn't speak, perhaps, but they shared something more intimate than words: desire, vulnerability, the tacit acknowledgment of needs that polite society pretended didn't exist. When the theaters closed, their patrons didn't vanish. The needs didn't disappear. They simply scattered into private viewing booths and online platforms, each man now alone with his screen, the possibility of unexpected human connection severed.

This is the paradox that modern states refuse to acknowledge: in our rush to create "clean" public spaces and "targeted" investments, we destroy the very conditions that make innovation possible. The same governments that pour billions into designated innovation districts—those airless archipelagos of glass and steel where "entrepreneurs" and "thought leaders" are meant to spontaneously combust into profitable novelty—systematically eliminate the actual spaces where cross-class, cross-cultural contact occurs. They fund the appearance of dynamism while strangling its reality.

The semiconductor industry offers a perfect case study in this bureaucratic blindness. Taiwan's TSMC didn't emerge from a government-designated tech park, though such parks came later. It grew from the night markets of Hsinchu, where engineers from different companies met after work, drinking beer among the food stalls, sharing gossip and technical problems, building the informal networks that would later formalize into the world's most important chip manufacturer. The Taiwanese state's genius wasn't in creating these spaces—night markets are older than memory—but in recognizing their value and refusing to "improve" them out of existence.

Contrast this with Silicon Valley's current incarnation: a region so expensive that the very engineers driving innovation can't afford to live there, commuting hours each day from distant suburbs, their potential random encounters reduced to scheduled Zoom calls and LinkedIn messages. The state—through zoning laws, tax structures, and development policies—has created an "innovation ecosystem" that systematically prevents the ecological mixing on which actual innovation depends.

But let me take you somewhere more intimate, more uncomfortable. The men's room at Grand Central Terminal, circa 1985. Not the restored marble palace you see today, but the grimy, dangerous, vital space it was then. Here, in the gaps between official society, another kind of public assembled. Gay men who couldn't afford the bars, homeless veterans washing in the sinks, commuters changing clothes after missing the last train home. The encounters were furtive, sometimes sexual, sometimes violent, always charged with possibility. When I speak of public space, I mean this too—the zones where society's edges fray and overlap, where the state's vision blurs, where humans connect in ways that no policy paper could predict or approve.

The renovation of Grand Central eliminated these spaces in the name of public safety and commercial optimization. Fair enough—I'm not advocating for dangerous bathrooms. But notice what wasn't created in their place: no new spaces for the men who once gathered there, no acknowledgment that they were meeting real human needs, however messily. They simply vanished from the official city, pushed into private apps and apartments, their public existence erased. The state spent $200 million to create a beautiful shopping mall where a train station used to be, and called it restoration.

This same pattern repeats at every scale. The European Union invests billions in "innovation missions"—moon shots for climate technology, digital transformation, health breakthroughs. Noble goals, certainly. But these missions consistently fail to ask the crucial question: where will the unexpected encounters happen? Where will the climate scientist meet the indigenous farmer? Where will the blockchain developer argue with the union organizer? The EU builds excellent conference centers and research institutes, but it systematically defunds the public squares, the night markets, the marginal spaces where actual transformation begins.

Consider unemployment offices—those bureaucratic purgatories where the state meets its most vulnerable citizens. Every government wants to digitize these services, to move the interactions online in the name of efficiency. But walk into any unemployment office and you'll see what screens can't capture: the informal job tips exchanged in waiting rooms, the solidarity forming between strangers sharing the same precarious position, the human connections that often matter more than the official services provided. These are innovation spaces too, though no government would dare call them that.

The mission-oriented state must be, above all, a state that understands contact. Not managed contact, not profitable contact, but the raw, unpredictable collision of different worlds that cities have always enabled and bureaucracies have always feared. This means investing not just in the bright, clean spaces where success is performed, but in the marginal zones where failure is survived, where need meets need without mediation, where the future first appears as something unrecognizable and often uncomfortable.

I think of the Arab tea houses in Belleville, where Tunisian cab drivers debate politics with Algerian shopkeepers while French students eavesdrop from the next table, learning more about North African society than any university course could teach. These spaces receive no government support—indeed, they're often targeted for closure as "security risks" or "noise violations." Yet they create more genuine cross-cultural understanding than a thousand officially funded integration programs. They are, in the truest sense, laboratories of democracy.

Or consider the public libraries that still function as genuine public spaces—not the renovated showcases with their corporate-sponsored maker spaces and strictly enforced silence, but the unrenovated branches where homeless people sleep in the reading rooms and teenagers flirt by the computers and immigrants practice English with volunteer tutors. These are the spaces where the public is actually produced, where strangers become citizens not through abstract ideology but through the simple act of sharing space, heat, and resources.

The state's role is not to design these encounters—they cannot be designed. Its role is to create the conditions where they can occur: abundant public space, radically accessible, open to uses that no planner imagined. This means resisting the urge to optimize, to monetize, to control. It means accepting that the most transformative innovations often look like waste, disorder, or moral failure to those who can't see their function.

When we speak of missions—ending climate change, creating equitable growth, building resilient societies—we must remember that these are not technical problems awaiting technical solutions. They are social transformations that will emerge, if at all, from millions of unplanned encounters between people who wouldn't otherwise meet. The state that grasps this will invest not just in research and development but in the urban infrastructures of contact: public squares that can't be privatized, transportation that mixes rather than segregates, spaces that remain open to the needs we don't yet know how to name.

The pornographic theater and the innovation lab are not opposites—they are different points on the same continuum of human need and possibility. Both create spaces where strangers become intimate, where boundaries dissolve, where new configurations of desire and knowledge become possible. The wise state funds both, though it may call them by different names. The foolish state, our current state, funds neither, offering instead the simulation of innovation in spaces drained of actual human contact.

We stand at a crossroads. We can continue building cities where every surface is monetized, every interaction surveilled, every deviation punished—smart cities for stupid humans, as one graffiti artist scrawled on a renovation fence. Or we can remember what cities are for: the production of possibilities that no one planned, no one funded, no one approved, but everyone needs. The choice is not between order and chaos, but between a dead order that strangles the future and a living chaos from which the future might actually emerge.

The next transformative technology will not be born in a boardroom or a laboratory. It will emerge from the conversation between two strangers who shouldn't have met, in a space that shouldn't have existed, creating value that no metric could have predicted. Our task is to build for that moment—not to control it, not to profit from it, but simply to make it possible. This is the true mission of the mission-oriented state: to create public spaces so rich, so porous, so genuinely public that the future has room to arrive.

In the end, we must choose between the city as machine and the city as body—between spaces that process us and spaces that produce us. The state that chooses the body, with all its messy needs and unruly desires, is the only state capable of generating the innovations we desperately need. Everything else is just rearranging the furniture while the house burns down.
