Morgan Tidewater - The Breathing Commons

The nuclear family is a sensory deprivation chamber. This is not metaphor but diagnosis: within its walls, we have severed the neural pathways that once connected human bodies to the breathing world, replacing the polyphony of earthly kinship with the monotone of blood relation. To abolish this suffocating structure is not merely a political project but an ecological necessity—a return to the animate earth that capitalism's domestic laboratories have trained us to forget.

Consider how a child learns the world. Not through the singular channel of parental interpretation, but through what should be a sprawling web of touch, taste, smell—aunts who know different plants, neighbors whose hands shape clay, elders whose stories carry the scent of seasons long past. The privatized household denies this multiplicity, funneling all sensory education through one or two exhausted adults who themselves learned alienation as birthright. The child's fingers, which might have known the texture of shared labor, instead clutch manufactured toys in solitary rooms.

The architecture tells the story: walls that block the movement of sound between dwellings, fences that interrupt the migration patterns of small creatures, windows that frame nature as view rather than participant. Inside, the family unit churns through its private dramas while outside, the more-than-human world continues its ancient conversations—wind through leaves, mycorrhizal networks trading nutrients, birdsong marking territory and desire. These two realms, artificially divided, grow mutually incomprehensible.

But bodies remember. Even within the domestic cage, our senses rebel. A teenager's skin hungers for touch beyond the sanctioned familial embrace. An infant's cry carries frequencies that evoke response not just from biological parents but from any lactating body within earshot—a communal summoning that modern walls work to contain. The elderly, warehoused away from the family home, maintain cellular memories of intergenerational compounds where knowledge passed through daily proximity, where death was witnessed rather than outsourced.

The violence of the nuclear family is precisely its claim to naturalness. We name it foundation, bedrock, basic unit—geological metaphors that disguise its recent invention and continued maintenance through force. Police return runaway children to abusive homes. Courts privilege biological connection over chosen care. Welfare systems punish collective households while subsidizing isolated ones. All to preserve a formation that serves capital by creating workers pre-trained in hierarchy, scarcity, and the acceptance of love as private property.

Yet alternative kinships persist like weeds through concrete. Queer families of choice restore the practice of many-bodied care. Indigenous communities maintain frameworks where land, ancestors, and future generations participate in child-rearing. Even within suburban enclaves, children create their own networks—secret paths between yards, languages of play that exclude adults, alliances that honor felt connection over blood mandate. These are not regressions but rememberings, the sensory intelligence of our species reasserting itself against amnesia.

The abolition of the family opens not into chaos but into what we might call the breathing commons—a way of being where care circulates like air, where need calls forth response from whoever is present to provide it. Here, the boundaries between human and more-than-human kinship dissolve. The same attention we might offer a crying infant extends to a drought-stressed tree, a polluted stream, a struggling neighbor. Care becomes ecological rather than genealogical.

This is not utopian fantasy but lived practice, visible wherever people organize beyond the family form. Community kitchens where strangers become kin through shared labor. Housing cooperatives where children move freely between units, gathering skills and stories from many adults. Gardens that feed whoever tends them. These spaces pulse with a different rhythm—not the metronomic tick of the family schedule but the seasonal, cyclical time of bodies in relation.

The pandemic offered a glimpse. As nuclear families found themselves truly isolated, their dysfunction became undeniable. Parents cracked under the pressure of being everything to their children. Children withered without peer contact. The elderly died alone while their relatives watched through windows. But simultaneously, mutual aid networks bloomed. Neighbors who had never spoken began sharing food, checking on each other's children, creating pod systems that resembled nothing so much as the extended kinship structures capital had convinced us to abandon.

What if we refused to return? What if we recognized the nuclear family as the historical aberration it is—a blip in the long story of human social organization, a structure as doomed as the economic system that birthed it? The earth itself argues against it. No species survives through isolated breeding pairs. Forests teach us that resilience comes through underground connection, through the sharing of resources across difference. The family form makes us stupid to these lessons, illiterate in the language of interdependence.

The path forward requires not just political organizing but sensory re-education. We must learn again to recognize kin by scent, by gait, by the particular way they prepare food. We must develop what we might call ecological proprioception—the ability to sense ourselves as part of a larger body that includes but exceeds the human. This is not regression to some imagined past but evolution toward a future where care is as abundant as breath.

Children know this intuitively. Watch them in spaces where the family form loosens—summer camps, schoolyards, anywhere adults step back. They create instant kinships, elaborate hierarchies that shift with the game, loyalties that fierce and fade with organic precision. They share food, share secrets, share touch with the promiscuity that adults have been trained to fear. In this, they are not naive but sophisticated, practicing for a world where love is not hoarded but generated through circulation.

The abolition of the family is fundamentally about this: releasing love from the prison of scarcity. Under the current system, we portion out care like a finite resource, saving the best for blood relations while strangers starve. But care is not conserved through hoarding. Like breath, like touch, like the nutrients cycling through forest soil, it increases through sharing. The family form teaches us to hold our breath. A world beyond it would teach us to breathe together.

This is not easy work. The family form has carved deep grooves in our neural pathways, trained our very cells to recognize some bodies as worthy of care and others as threat. Unlearning requires practice, patience, the willingness to feel the discomfort of connection across difference. It requires us to sit with the grief of what the family form has cost us—the aunts we never had, the children we couldn't help, the elders whose wisdom we never received.

But on the other side of that grief lies possibility. A world where no child grows up in the echo chamber of parental projection. Where no adult carries the sole burden of another's survival. Where the words "family" and "stranger" lose their oppositional meaning. Where we might finally hear what the more-than-human world has been trying to tell us all along: that we are already kin, already connected, already breathing the same air and drinking the same water and growing from the same soil.

The nuclear family promised to protect us from the wildness of the world. Instead, it has protected us from its gifts. To abolish it is not to destroy love but to let it grow wild again, spreading like spores on the wind, taking root wherever it lands. This is the breathing commons—not a place but a practice, not a structure but a series of relationships that honor the porousness of our bodies and the inevitability of our connection.

The earth is waiting for us to remember. With every breath, it offers the same invitation: to expand our understanding of home beyond the suffocating walls of private property, to recognize our kinship with all that breathes, to practice care as a collective art rather than a private burden. The abolition of the family is simply the acceptance of this invitation—the choice to stop holding our breath and start breathing together.
