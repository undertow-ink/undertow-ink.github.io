Kwame Garrison - The Auction of Tomorrow

The future arrives not through grand proclamations but through the mundane machinery of allocation—who gets what, who decides, and who benefits. In a small district outside Lagos, an experiment unfolds that challenges both our conventional wisdom about property and our comfortable assumptions about progress. Here, local residents don't merely own their homes; they continuously bid for the right to remain, their property taxes determined not by distant assessors but by their neighbors' willingness to pay. It is a system that sounds dystopian to Western ears, yet it has produced something unexpected: the most equitable distribution of land in the region.

This is not merely a story about an innovative property scheme. It is about how our most radical solutions often emerge from the margins, only to be captured and domesticated by the very forces they were meant to challenge. The Lagos experiment began as a response to elite capture—wealthy speculators had been buying up land, leaving longtime residents displaced and dispossessed. The continuous auction system was designed to ensure that those who valued the land most highly, in the truest sense of connection and community rather than mere financial speculation, would retain it. Yet within five years, international development organizations had seized upon the model, stripping it of its communal safeguards and exporting a hollowed-out version to three continents.

The mechanism itself is elegantly simple, almost mathematical in its beauty. Each property owner lists a self-assessed value for their property, paying a tax of 7% annually on that declared amount. But here's the radical element: anyone can purchase the property at the listed price. This self-assessment mechanism achieves what centuries of property law could not—it forces honesty about value while preventing hoarding. Set your price too high, and you're overtaxed. Set it too low, and you risk losing what you cherish. The system generates revenue that flows directly to community investment, funding schools, clinics, and cooperative enterprises.

Yet the devil, as always, lurks in the implementation details. The original Lagos model included crucial protections: community members had right of first refusal, elderly residents received tax exemptions, and cultural sites were held in collective trust. These weren't mere add-ons but fundamental features that prevented the system from becoming another tool of displacement. When the World Bank's consultants arrived, clipboards in hand and metrics at the ready, they saw inefficiencies where the community saw safeguards. In their cleaned-up version, exported to pilot programs in Cambodia and Guatemala, these protections vanished. The mathematical elegance remained, but stripped of its social consciousness, it became a weapon aimed at the very communities it was meant to serve.

Consider what happens when we mistake the mechanism for the solution. In the Cambodian pilot, small farmers found themselves in bidding wars with agricultural conglomerates. The continuous auction system, designed to prevent speculation, instead accelerated it. Without community controls, without the social infrastructure that made the Lagos model work, the elegant mathematics of allocative efficiency became a cold calculation of displacement. The consultants celebrated the increased tax revenue and "improved" land utilization, blind to the families loading their possessions onto trucks, driven from ancestral lands by the very system meant to protect them.

This is how elite capture operates in our age of innovation—not through crude appropriation but through selective adoption. The powerful don't steal ideas wholesale; they perform careful surgery, extracting the components that serve their interests while discarding those that might constrain them. They take the language of radical reform and speak it with forked tongues, until even we begin to doubt our own visions. The continuous auction becomes just another auction. The community land trust becomes just another trust. The revolution becomes just another restructuring.

But the Lagos community offers us a different lesson, one written not in policy papers but in the lived experience of maintained neighborhoods and preserved communities. They show us that radical mechanisms require radical politics—that tools designed to challenge existing power structures cannot be divorced from the movements that wield them. When residents gather monthly to review assessment values, when they collectively decide that the community center's value transcends any price anyone could pay, when they use the auction system's revenue to fund cooperative businesses that give young people reasons to stay rather than flee to the cities, they demonstrate that our boldest innovations must be grounded in the oldest truths: that solidarity trumps efficiency, that community knowledge exceeds expert optimization, that the future we build must be one we build together.

The international development establishment looks at Lagos and sees a successful pilot program, a proof of concept ready for scale. They prepare their PowerPoints and marshal their funding, eager to spread this new gospel of efficient allocation. But they miss the most crucial insight: the system works not because of its elegant mechanism but because of who controls it. In the hands of the community, continuous auctions become tools of collective empowerment. In the hands of distant technocrats, they become instruments of a more sophisticated dispossession.

This tension—between mechanism and meaning, between innovation and implementation—defines our current moment. We live in an era of radical proposals and conservative applications, where our boldest ideas are routinely conscripted into service of the status quo. The solution is not to abandon our radical imagination but to guard it more fiercely, to insist that our innovations come embedded with their politics, that our mechanisms remain married to their movements.

The residents of that Lagos district understood something that eludes many of our brightest policy minds: that true reform requires not just new rules but new rulers, not just different mechanisms but different meanings. They built a system that acknowledges a fundamental truth—that property is always social, that ownership is always relational, that our individual claims must be balanced against our collective needs. More importantly, they kept control of that system, ensuring that its radical potential would not be diluted by distant interpreters or captured by elite interests.

As I write this, three more cities have announced pilots of "continuous assessment property systems." The consultants are already on planes, the frameworks are being adapted, the safeguards are being marked as "inefficiencies to be addressed in Version 2.0." But in Lagos, the original community continues its experiment, a living reminder that our most powerful tools for change are only as strong as the movements that wield them, only as radical as the politics that guide them, only as transformative as our collective will to see them through.

The auction continues, but the future remains unbought.
