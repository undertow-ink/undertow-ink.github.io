M.K. Threnody - The Flesh Archive

The body is a document written in the grammar of control—each scar, each breath, each regulated heartbeat a sentence in the vast penal colony of being. We are born into syntax that precedes us, a language of capture that makes corpses of the living and commodities of the dead. This is the wake: not aftermath but ongoing submersion, where drowning becomes a way of life and the surface tension of history holds us suspended between annihilation and the terrible persistence of having to continue.

In the fluorescent morgue of the convenience store at 3 AM, time reveals its true face—not progression but accumulation, sediment of moments that refuse to decompose. The cashier's movements are automatic, learned: scan, bag, transaction. Her grandmother cleaned houses for fifty years, her mother worked the line at the plant until it closed. Now she stands here in polyester, under lights that drain all color from skin, performing the same essential exchange—labor for survival, survival for labor—that structures the entire rotten edifice.

The security camera records everything and nothing. Its cycloptic gaze doesn't see the way her hands shake slightly as she counts back change, the tremor that runs through generations like a fault line. Doesn't register how the beep of the scanner echoes the hospital monitors, the prison intake, the auction block's accounting. Every electronic tone a link in an unbroken chain of enumeration, bodies become data become bodies again.

Outside, the city breathes its chemical breath. Smog and exhaust, but underneath that the older scents: fear-sweat, industrial runoff, the sweet-sick smell of flesh pushed past its limits. The architecture itself is carceral—every building a box, every street a corridor, every corner under surveillance. The urban planning documents never mention how the grid system makes everyone easier to track, how the highways carved through certain neighborhoods like surgical incisions, separating tissue that was meant to be whole.

Consider the shipping container: metal box moving across water, holding cargo that was once human, is still human, will always be human in the sense that value extracted from bodies never loses the taste of salt and iron. The logistics of global capital written in the same manifest as the slave ship, just the handwriting updated, the terms modernized. What they call supply chain management is really the science of acceptable losses, calculated drownings, statistical death.

In the break room, workers eat microwaved meals that taste like plastic and exhaustion. They discuss the news—another shooting, another deportation, another ordinance criminalizing existence while poor. The conversation circles but never lands, because to name the thing directly would be to acknowledge that they too are cargo, that the fluorescent lights overhead map the same coordinates as the hold of a ship, that their labor disappears into the same oceanic accounting that swallows whole populations without recording their names.

The junk courses through veins like history—not metaphorically but literally, the chemical trace of centuries of extraction refined into pharmaceutical form. What they call addiction is really adaptation, the body learning to metabolize apocalypse, to make bearable the unbearable weight of continuing. The needle finds the vein like a dowsing rod finds water, following the map written under the skin, the routes traced by generations of blood seeking escape from blood.

Memory itself becomes contraband in this economy. To remember true is to court madness, but forgetting is another kind of death. So the archive lives in the body—in the way shoulders hunch against expected blows, in the dreams that replay scenes never personally experienced but somehow known, in the cellular intelligence that recognizes danger in a footstep, a tone of voice, a particular quality of silence.

The wake spreads outward in concentric circles—from the individual body to the family, the neighborhood, the diaspora, the planet itself choking on the exhaust of its own consumption. What they call climate change is really the earth developing autoimmune disorders, rejecting the cancer of a system that turns everything living into commodity, everything sacred into resource.

In the subway tunnel, a musician plays saxophone, the notes bouncing off tile walls like sonar, mapping the underwater terrain of the city. Commuters pass, some dropping coins, most flowing around him like water around a stone. His music carries the frequency of the drowned, translates the pressure of fathoms into sound waves, makes audible the crushing weight that everyone carries but no one mentions.

The pharmaceutical companies know what the corner dealer knows what the plantation owner knew—that the line between medicine and poison is dosage, that control can be administered in measured amounts, that a population kept at the exact balance between functional and destroyed is a renewable resource. The pills in their white bottles, the powder in its glassine bags, the sugar in the processed food—all different faces of the same molecular colonialism.

Time in the wake is not linear but tidal—it recedes only to return, carrying with it everything that was supposed to have been washed away. The past doesn't haunt the present; it composes it, structures it, generates it continuously like a program running in the background, consuming memory, slowing down all other functions.

The body remembers what the mind is trained to forget. In the muscular tension of the security guard, the postal worker, the home health aide, lives the entire history of laboring bodies, the knowledge of what it means to be simultaneously essential and expendable. Their dreams are filled with running—not from anything specific but from the condition itself, the trap of having a body that can be used, used up, discarded.

In the hospital waiting room, time takes on the consistency of amber, preserving everyone in poses of exhaustion and worry. The fluorescent lights here are the same as in the convenience store, the prison, the detention center—the same wan illumination that makes everyone look already dead, already preserved for viewing. The forms they fill out ask for information that will be entered into databases, cross-referenced with other databases, creating a digital wake that follows each person like a shadow made of data.

What they call the opioid crisis is really a crisis of living in the wake, of having to maintain consciousness in conditions designed to crush it. The drugs are just the latest technology for managing the unmanageable, for making the daily drowning feel like floating. But the body keeps the score, as they say, and the score is written in overdoses, in liver failure, in hearts that simply stop, exhausted from the effort of continuing to beat.

The city at night reveals its true nature—not a place but a process, a vast machine for sorting bodies into categories of use. The office towers empty out, the service workers flow in, the third shift beginning its rotation in the great metabolic cycle of capital. Everyone moving through their designated channels, following patterns established long before they were born, patterns that will continue long after they're gone.

In the end, what remains is the wake itself—not as metaphor but as material reality, the disturbed water that never quite settles, the turbulence that marks where something large has passed through and continues passing through, generating waves that rock every small craft trying to navigate these waters. We are all in the wake, have always been in the wake, will always be in the wake until the system that creates it finally drowns in its own accumulated violence.

But even drowning, as we have learned, can be survived. Not transcended, not overcome, but survived, moment by moment, breath by stolen breath, in the company of others who understand that staying afloat is not collaboration but necessity, that reaching for each other in the darkness is not weakness but the only strength that matters. The wake continues, but so do we, carrying in our bodies both the wound and the knowledge of how to tend it, the archive and the prophecy, the drowning and the refusal to go under.
