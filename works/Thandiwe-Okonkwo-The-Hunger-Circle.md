Thandiwe Okonkwo - The Hunger Circle

The doughnut sits on the table like a zero, like nothing, like everything. Sweet glaze catching fluorescent light in this township café where the coffee tastes of burnt earth and disappointment. I trace its circular edge with my finger, this Western confection that somehow contains all of economics, all of ecology, all of our gnawing hunger.

Between the outer crust and the inner void lies the safe space for humanity. Kate would draw it with precise lines, measured boundaries. But here in the heat-drunk afternoon, the boundaries blur like mirages on tarmac. The social foundation—housing, water, energy, food—these are not abstract concepts but the very texture of survival, the bitter taste of want that never leaves your mouth.

I've seen the overshoot, the ecological ceiling breached daily in the chrome and glass towers that pierce the sky like accusations. Climate change isn't a future threat; it's the present fever that makes the corrugated iron roofs buckle and warp, turning homes into ovens where children bake slowly in their sleep. Ocean acidification—such clinical words for the death of everything that swims, for fishermen returning with empty nets and emptier stomachs.

The regenerative economy demands we think in circles, not lines. Growth forever upward—that colonial fantasy that infected us like tuberculosis, spreading through our lungs until we couldn't breathe anything but the promise of more. More extraction. More accumulation. More hunger.

But hunger is already circular. It feeds on itself, a serpent swallowing its tail. The child who cannot concentrate in school because breakfast was water and hope. The mother who sells her body to buy mealie meal. The father who drinks to forget he cannot provide. Round and round, generation after generation, the wheel turns.

We are taught to worship GDP like a jealous god, offering our forests and rivers as burnt sacrifices. Three percent growth! Five percent growth! The newspapers shout these numbers like incantations. But growth of what? The slums expand like cancer cells. The inequality gap yawns wider, a mouth that could swallow nations.

In the doughnut model, there's a space between deprivation and excess where humanity can thrive. But that space feels like a tightrope strung across an abyss. One false step and you plummet either into ecological breakdown or social foundation collapse. Most of us never even reach the rope; we're born already falling.

The distributive economy—sharing wealth at the point of creation rather than redistributing crumbs later—sounds like revolution whispered in academic language. Every time I hear an economist speak of "market solutions," I think of the market women who rise at 3 AM to catch the first bus, who measure profit in school fees paid and children fed. Their economy is already circular, already regenerative, turning discarded vegetables into soup, plastic bottles into schoolbags, survival into an art form.

I watch a fly circle the doughnut, attracted to its sweetness. Even this insect understands abundance better than our systems do. It takes what it needs and moves on. But we have built a machine that must consume everything, that mistakes depletion for value creation.

The ecological ceiling presses down while the social foundation crumbles beneath us. We live in the collapsing space between, gasping for air that tastes of sulphur and unfulfilled promises. The doughnut economy asks us to reimagine everything—money, markets, metrics. But first, we must reimagine ourselves.

In my grandmother's village, they still practice ukama, the understanding that we are all related, all connected in an infinite web. When drought comes, they share the last grain. When rain falls, they dance together. This is the embedded economy, where market is servant, not master. Where the commons are sacred, not commodities.

But the city has eaten the village. The lines on the graph have devoured the circles of community. We measure what we've lost in rising temperatures and falling water tables, in suicide rates and species extinctions. The data tells the story our hearts already know: we are consuming ourselves.

The regenerative city, the circular economy, the distributive state—these are not mere policy proposals but prayers for resurrection. Can dead soil live again? Can poisoned rivers run clear? Can a people who have forgotten how to share remember the taste of common bread?

I finish the doughnut, leaving only crumbs and the faint outline of grease on the plate. A perfect circle made of absence. This is what we must design—an economy shaped by what we choose not to take, not to extract, not to destroy. An economy of enough.

Outside, the street vendors are packing up their wares as evening approaches. Tomorrow they'll return, setting up their fragile stalls in the margins of the formal economy. They are the real circular economists, turning waste into livelihood, relationships into resilience. They know that the economy is not a machine but a garden, requiring tending, patience, and the wisdom to let some things lie fallow.

The doughnut model promises a safe and just space for humanity. But justice tastes different on an empty stomach. Safety means something else when the police are predators and home is a shack that floods with every rain. We need new metrics, yes, but first we need new eyes to see that wealth includes birdsong and poverty includes the absence of stars bleached out by city lights.

In the end, all economics is home economics. The Greek oikos, meaning household, reminds us that we are merely managing our common home. But the house is hungry, always hungry, devouring its own foundations to feed a growth that serves no one.

I leave coins on the table—the circular economy in miniature, metal rounds that will pass from hand to hand, connecting strangers in an endless dance of exchange. Outside, the city sprawls in all directions, a vast experiment in how many boundaries we can cross before the experiment ends.

The doughnut economy is not a destination but a navigation tool, a compass for the journey between enough and too much, between absence and excess. We are all walking that edge, trying not to fall into the hungry void at the center or tumble over the ecological precipice at the periphery.

Perhaps that's what development means: learning to live in the space between two hungers—the hunger for more that drives us over the edge, and the hunger for enough that keeps us human. In that narrow band between deficiency and excess lies everything worth saving, everything worth being.

The streetlights flicker on, each one a small sun burning fossil light. Night falls on the circular city, the circular economy, the circular hunger that connects us all. Tomorrow we'll wake and trace the same patterns, hoping that this time the circle will hold, that the doughnut will be sweet, that the space for humanity will be wide enough for all of us.

But tonight, we dream of gardens growing through concrete, of rivers remembering their courses, of an economics written not in equations but in the restored laughter of children who have never known hunger. This is the heresy we must believe: that another world is not only possible but already growing in the cracks of this one, waiting for us to notice, to nurture, to choose.

The doughnut economy is a love letter to a future we might yet inhabit. But first, we must survive the hunger of the present, the carnivorous systems that mistake us for food. We must become economists of our own survival, theorists of our own thriving, architects of the space between two zeros where life persists against all odds.

This is our work: to make the circle sacred again, to remember that all boundaries are permeable, that what affects one affects all. To build an economy that serves life rather than consuming it. To find the sweet spot between too little and too much where humanity might finally rest.

The hunger continues, but so does the feast. We are always both starving and satisfied, always falling and flying, always breaking the boundaries and mending them. This is the human economy: a doughnut made of dreams and bitter reality, forever promising sweetness, forever demanding we share.
