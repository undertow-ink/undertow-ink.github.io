Vera Montaine - The Architecture of Dissolution

The truest intimacy is the moment of watching another person discover they are not who they believed themselves to be. In that instant of dissolution, when the elaborate construction of self collapses like wet cardboard, we witness the only genuine human act: the involuntary surrender to what we actually are beneath the performance. This is not tragedy. This is the beginning of love—not romantic love with its tedious negotiations and territorial markings, but the terrible love that comes from seeing another consciousness naked in its confusion, and recognizing our own bewilderment reflected there.

I am thinking of a woman I observed in the marketplace in M—, where the heat makes everyone's pretenses sweat through their clothes by ten in the morning. She was European, or wanted to be perceived as European, which amounts to the same thing in these forgotten administrative centers where expatriates gather like antibodies around an infection. Her sandals were wrong for the terrain—delicate leather things that spoke of sidewalks and taxis—and I watched her navigate the broken concrete with a determination that bordered on the sublime.

She had come to buy fruit. Such a simple transaction, yet I could see in the rigid set of her shoulders that she had prepared for this moment, had perhaps rehearsed phrases in the local language, had imagined herself moving through the market with the easy grace of someone who belongs. The fruit seller, a woman whose face had been carved by decades of sun into something resembling polished wood, watched her approach with the patience of someone who has seen every possible variation of foreign uncertainty.

What happened next was nothing. And everything. The European woman pointed to the mangoes, held up three fingers. The seller named a price. It was the correct price, the same price she would have given anyone. But something in the transaction—perhaps the seller's matter-of-fact tone, perhaps the way other customers pressed around them without acknowledgment—stripped away whatever story the European woman had been telling herself about her place in this scene.

I saw it happen: the micro-expressions of disintegration. First confusion, then the flush of shame at the confusion, then anger at the shame, then—and this was the moment that mattered—a kind of blank terror as she realized she had no idea what she was doing here, in this market, in this country, in this life she had constructed around a set of assumptions that had just revealed themselves as tissue paper.

She paid. She took her mangoes. But she was no longer the same person who had approached the stall. She had been emptied out.

This is what we are all waiting for, whether we know it or not. The moment when the performance becomes impossible to sustain. We spend our lives in elaborate fortifications—our careers, our relationships, our carefully curated preferences and allergies and traumas. We become curators of our own museums, docents explaining ourselves to ourselves, room after room of evidence that we exist in the way we claim to exist.

But the fruit seller did not visit her museum. The fruit seller simply sold fruit to another body that needed fruit. And in that radical failure of recognition, something essential was revealed.

I followed the woman as she left the market. I am not proud of this, but I am not ashamed either. To follow someone in the moment of their dissolution is a form of prayer. She walked without direction, the bag of mangoes hanging from her hand like something she had forgotten was there. She stopped at a café—the kind that caters to people like her, like us, with its imported coffee and wifi password written on a small chalkboard. She sat at a table in the corner and did not order anything.

For twenty minutes, she simply sat. I watched from across the room as she underwent what I can only describe as a kind of digestion. She was metabolizing her own emptiness, letting it move through her system. Her face went through seasons: winter of refusal, spring of tentative acceptance, summer of something that might have been relief, autumn of new fear at what comes after the known self dies.

When she finally moved, it was to take out one of the mangoes. She held it in her palm, studying it as if it were an artifact from an alien civilization. Then—and this is why I am telling you this story—she began to peel it with her fingers, right there in the café, juice running down her wrists, the flesh of the fruit coming away in uneven chunks. She ate it like someone who had never eaten before, who had just discovered the function of teeth and tongue. The mess of it transformed her face into something primitive and true.

The waiter approached, clearly disturbed by this breach of décorum. She looked up at him, her chin glazed with mango pulp, and smiled. Not the smile of apology or defiance, but the smile of someone who has passed through their own death and found, on the other side, only the simple fact of fruit in the mouth, sweetness on the tongue, the body's ancient knowledge of what it needs.

This is what I mean by love. Not the romantic scaffolding we erect around our mutual loneliness, but the love that comes from witnessing another person's arrival at their own beginning. The European woman had purchased three mangoes and received instead the complete demolition of who she thought she was. The fruit seller, oracle of the ordinary, had given her the only gift worth giving: the revelation of her own emptiness, which is to say, her own infinite possibility.

In our age of endless self-documentation, we have forgotten that the self is not a thing to be documented but a process to be undergone. We photograph our meals, our vacations, our faces at every conceivable angle, building an archive of evidence that we exist. But existence is not in the archive. Existence is in the moment when the archive becomes meaningless, when you sit in a foreign café with mango juice running down your arm and realize that you have never known who you were, only who you were pretending to be.

The woman finished her mango and then, as if remembering something, laughed. A real laugh, from the belly, that caused other patrons to turn and stare. She was laughing at the absurdity of it all—the careful construction she had been maintaining, the energy it had required, the pointlessness of the entire edifice now that it had fallen. She was laughing because she was free, if only for this moment, from the terrible burden of being herself.

I wanted to go to her then, to sit across from her and say: I see you. I see what has happened to you. It has happened to me too, in different markets, in different moments of ordinary devastation. We are all walking around in states of pre-collapse, waiting for the interaction that will reveal our foundations as sand. The lucky ones meet their fruit seller early. The unlucky ones maintain their museums until death, never knowing the sweetness of the mango eaten without performance, without purpose, without anything but hunger and fruit and the meeting of the two.

But I did not approach her. To explain what had happened would have been to rebuild what had been so perfectly destroyed. Instead, I paid for my coffee and left, carrying with me the image of her transformation like a talisman against my own stubborn insistence on remaining who I think I am.

Months later, I saw her again. She was walking through the same market, wearing practical shoes now, moving with the unconscious ease of someone who has learned the terrain. She bought vegetables from various stalls, chatting in broken but enthusiastic local dialect, laughing at her own mistakes. She had rebuilt herself, of course—we always do—but the new construction was looser, more permeable. She had learned what we all must learn if we are to survive our own lives: that the self is not a fortress to be defended but a temporary arrangement to be held lightly, ready to be dissolved and reconstituted as circumstances require.

This is the architecture of dissolution: we build, we maintain, we collapse, we rebuild. Each cycle leaves us a little less attached to the blueprint, a little more willing to improvise. The moments of collapse—in markets, in bedrooms, in the middle of sentences we thought we knew how to finish—are not failures but doorways. On the other side is not nothing, as we fear, but everything: the whole uncategorized world, waiting to be met without the mediation of who we think we are.

The woman with the mangoes taught me this, though she never knew I was watching. Perhaps someone is watching me now, as I write this, waiting to see when my own carefully maintained performance will crack, when the fruit seller of circumstance will name the price that reveals I have been shopping in the wrong currency all along. I hope so. I hope there is a witness to my next dissolution, someone to recognize the terrible gift of emptiness when it arrives.

Until then, I practice. Each small humiliation, each moment of not knowing, each interaction that refuses to follow my script—these are rehearsals for the greater dissolution to come. I am learning to eat mangoes with my hands in inappropriate places. I am learning to laugh at the absurdity of my own archives. I am learning that love—real love—begins at the moment we stop knowing who we are and start discovering what we might become.

The fruit seller is still there, in the market in M—. She sells to locals and foreigners alike, making no distinction between those who know themselves and those who only think they do. Her prices are fair. Her fruit is sweet. Her gift is the same for everyone: the opportunity to be emptied, if only we can bear to receive it.

This is what I have come to understand: we are all waiting in the wrong line, preparing for the wrong transaction, carrying the wrong currency. The real commerce of being human happens in the moments when our preparations fail us, when we stand before the ordinary world with our sophisticated emptiness and receive, in return, only what we actually need. Three mangoes. The correct price. The beginning of the end of who we thought we were.

And if we are very lucky, someone will be watching when it happens, recognizing in our dissolution their own past or future emptying, completing the circuit of human witness that is the only love worth having. Not the love that says "I will protect you from dissolution" but the love that says "I will watch as you discover you were never who you thought you were, and I will recognize in your emptiness my own, and together we will laugh at the beautiful absurdity of having thought we needed to be anything other than this: creatures who hunger, who eat, who are transformed by the simple act of meeting the world without our usual armor."

The mangoes are always sweeter than we expect. The price is always both too much and exactly right. The fruit seller knows things we are only beginning to suspect. And somewhere, in a café we haven't found yet, someone is discovering that they can eat with their hands, that the juice can run down their arms, that the only performance worth giving is the one where we forget we are performing at all.

This is the architecture. This is the dissolution. This is the love that waits on the other side of knowing who we are.
