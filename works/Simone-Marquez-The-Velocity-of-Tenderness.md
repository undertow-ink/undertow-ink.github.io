Simone Marquez - The Velocity of Tenderness

The most violent act in contemporary life is the refusal to be consumed. In supermarkets, in love, in the theater of identity, we are meant to dissolve—to become product, to offer ourselves as aesthetic material for others' hunger. But what happens to the body that insists on its own bitter seeds, its own seasons of ripening and rot? This is not a question of resistance but of a more fundamental disorder: the scandal of remaining oneself while the world demands you become digestible.

Consider the tomato. Not the idealized sphere of August farmers' markets, but the pale December specimen, shipped across oceans, gassed into a mockery of ripeness. It performs tomato-ness without ever having known sun. This is what we ask of each other now—to perform our essential qualities without the conditions that would make them possible. To be ripe without season, sweet without soil.

I am thinking of a woman I saw on the M4 bus, counting coins from a plastic bag. Her hands moved with the precision of someone who has learned that each gesture costs something. She wore a wig that had shifted slightly, revealing her own hair underneath—gray at the roots, a secret the synthetic auburn couldn't quite cover. The other passengers looked away, that particular metropolitan kindness that masquerades as giving privacy. But I watched her, recognizing something in the methodical sorting of quarters and dimes that spoke to a larger economy—the careful rationing of self-presentation, the mathematics of appearing whole.

This is the contemporary paradox: we must appear natural while being entirely constructed. The organic tomato labeled as such in the fluorescent produce aisle exists only in relation to its unnamed alternative—the merely "tomato" tomato, unmarked because it is the norm. So too with identity. The performance of authenticity requires constant annotation, constant proof. But what if we acknowledged instead that we are all greenhouse subjects, grown under artificial light?

The moon pulls at more than tides. There's a reason we speak of lunacy, of being moonstruck. Under its influence, categorical boundaries soften. The firm tomato splits its skin. The careful performance of selfhood wavers. I once spent a night in a garden in Provence, watching the moon move across the sky while tomatoes hung heavy on their vines. By morning, several had fallen, too ripe to hold their own weight. This is what we fear—not failure, but excess. Not the inability to be ourselves, but the possibility of being too much ourselves.

In the museum, we stand before portraits of people whose names we don't know, painted by artists seeking to capture what they called "truth to life." But life's truth is that we are always in motion, always decomposing and recomposing. The portrait lies not in its stillness but in its suggestion that there was ever a moment of completion, a perfect ripeness to preserve.

The woman on the bus finished counting her coins. $3.75. Enough for the journey, not enough for the return. She tucked the bag into her purse and adjusted her wig, a gesture so practiced it had become unconscious. When she stood to exit, I saw she wore men's shoes—practical, brown, polished to a dignity that denied their obvious wear. This is how we survive: through these small insistences on form when the content threatens to spill over.

There's violence in the greenhouse and violence in the garden. The difference is only in who controls the seasons. When we speak of natural cycles, we forget that nature includes death, includes the fruit that rots on the ground, includes the moon that disappears entirely before returning. We have created a culture that demands perpetual harvest, perpetual visibility, perpetual readiness to be consumed.

But some nights, when the moon is dark, I remember that we are allowed to disappear. That there is resistance in refusing to fruit on schedule, in letting our surfaces tell the truth about our interiors. The tomato that splits reveals its wet, seeded heart—not beautiful by supermarket standards, but honest about what it means to be a living thing subject to time.

The deepest radical act may be this admission of seasonality, this insistence that we are not available for consumption in all months. That sometimes we are green and bitter. That sometimes we fall from the vine before anyone is ready. That our refusal to be preserved, packaged, and shipped might be the only way we maintain what makes us worth tasting in the first place.

In the end, the woman from the bus and the tomato in December teach the same lesson: authenticity is not about returning to some natural state but about acknowledging the conditions of our artificial cultivation. We are all greenhouse varieties now, grown under unnatural light. The question is whether we can find beauty in this admission, whether we can create meaning from the very fact of our construction.

The moon continues its cycles, indifferent to our cataloging. The tomatoes continue to grow, to ripen, to rot, whether we witness them or not. And we continue to perform ourselves daily, knowing that the performance is both a lie and the only truth available. This is neither tragedy nor triumph. It is simply the condition of being alive in a world that insists we be both real and representation, both fruit and its image, both the thing itself and its shadow on the wall.
