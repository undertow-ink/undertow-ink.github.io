Aurelia Blackwood - The Weight of Seeing

The morning arrives like a question mark, hooking itself into the space between what I know and what I pretend to know. Outside, the dogwood bleeds white petals onto grass that remembers yesterday's rain, each blade bent with the weight of drops that have already evaporated into meaning. Or meaninglessness. The distinction matters less than the looking itself.

I am watching my neighbor—no, I am being watched by the act of watching—as he tends his garden, his movements a kind of grammar I'm learning to misread. He knows I watch. This knowledge sits between us like a third person at a table set for two. When he plants, he plants for an audience of one who will never acknowledge the performance. This is our contract, unsigned but binding.

What is it to see another person? Really see them? Not the surface—Lord knows we've mastered that particular blindness—but the underneath, where the real living happens. The place where thoughts move like schools of fish, darting away from the light of attention.

                    The space between
    his hand and the soil
                              measures exactly
    one lie we tell ourselves
                    about touching—

He is Black. I am white. These are facts that hang in the air like laundry that will never quite dry, always damp with history's perspiration. We perform a careful ballet of neighborliness, each gesture calibrated to avoid the minefield of America's original sin. Good morning. Nice weather. Your roses look beautiful this year. We speak in code because the truth would undo us both.

But here's what haunts me: in my watching, am I stealing something from him? Some essential privacy that belongs to him alone? Or worse—am I creating him, moment by moment, glance by glance, fashioning him from my own need to be absolved of something I can't even name?

The mind wants to make metaphors of everything. The garden becomes paradise, exile, the middle passage, resurrection. But sometimes a garden is just a garden, and a man tending it is just trying to make something grow in soil that's seen too much.

                    What the earth knows:
    every root
                    is an argument
    against forgetting—
                              every bloom
    a temporary amnesty
                    from the weight
    of being seen—

Yesterday, a young white woman jogged past his house, clutched her phone tighter when she saw him watering his roses at dusk. He noticed. I noticed him noticing. She noticed nothing at all, wrapped in the armor of her obliviousness. This is how it works: the watchers and the watched, the seers and the seen, all of us caught in a web of glances that can wound or heal, depending on the angle of approach.

I think about Du Bois and his veil, how he must have felt it like a second skin, permeable only to pain. My neighbor—his name is Jerome, though I've never used it to his face, the intimacy too presumptuous—carries himself with a dignity that seems both armor and burden. When he smiles, it's like watching someone decide to trust the ice beneath their feet.

                    In the moment between
    seedling and bloom—
                              that pause
    where anything might still
                    happen—
    we are all innocent
                              of what we'll become—

The philosophy books on my shelf offer no guidance here. Kant would speak of categorical imperatives, Levinas of the face of the other, but what do they know of this particular morning, this specific light falling on this exact garden? Theory evaporates in the presence of an actual human being, kneeling in actual dirt, planting actual seeds that will grow into actual food that will sustain an actual life.

And yet. And yet. The mind cannot stop its reaching, its desperate attempt to make sense of what resists sense. I am a watcher who wishes not to watch, a neighbor who cannot figure out how to be neighborly without being either condescending or cold. The space between our houses might as well be an ocean. Or a history. Or both.

Jerome stands, brushes dirt from his knees. For a moment, our eyes meet across the distance. He nods. I nod. This is our daily communion, brief as a heartbeat, laden as a library. Then he returns to his work, and I to my watching, both of us pretending this is enough.

                    What saves us:
    the persistence of seasons—
                              how the earth
    refuses to learn
                    from its mistakes—
    how we plant again
                              in the same scarred soil—

The sun climbs higher, burning off the dew, revealing the world in its harsh particulars. Soon it will be too hot to garden, too bright to see clearly. But for now, in this liminal hour, we continue our parallel work: he cultivating his plot of earth, I cultivating my plot of understanding, both of us failing and trying and failing and trying again, which might be the only honest thing any of us can do.

The dogwood drops another petal. Time passes. Nothing is resolved. Everything continues. This, too, is a kind of knowledge, though what kind, I cannot say. Cannot say, but feel in my bones, which remember their own planting in this difficult soil, their own reaching toward a light that both reveals and blinds.

In the end, what else is there but this: two people, separated by history and brought together by proximity, each tending their own garden, each carrying their own portion of the world's weight, each looking and being looked at in turn, the watching and the watched becoming, finally, indistinguishable in the morning light that falls, democratic and merciless, on us all.
