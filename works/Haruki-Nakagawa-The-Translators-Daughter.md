Haruki Nakagawa - The Translator's Daughter

In the end, we are all translators of our own humiliation, rendering the untranslatable fact of our existence into languages that will never suffice. This is the burden that modernity has placed upon us: to live between tongues that cannot speak our truths, in bodies that betray our deepest comprehensions, reaching always for a home that recedes with each word we utter.

I am writing this in English, though I think in Japanese. Already the betrayal has begun.

My daughter calls from Toronto, where she teaches comparative literature to undergraduates who cannot fathom why anyone would read novels in translation. "The original is always better," they insist, these children who have never known the particular ache of living between languages, who mistake their monolingual privilege for purity. She tells me this in English, occasionally slipping into Japanese when the English words feel too sharp, too clinical for what she means to convey. I hear in her voice the same weariness I carry—the exhaustion of perpetual translation, not merely of words but of self.

"Papa," she says, and already I hear how the word has changed in her mouth, how it carries different frequencies than otōsan, how even this most intimate address has been colonized by distance. "My students want to know why I teach Tanizaki alongside Achebe. They say I'm conflating different experiences of colonialism."

I want to tell her that all experience is colonial now, that we are all subjects of an empire that speaks in algorithms and market forces, but I know she knows this. Instead, I ask about the weather in Toronto, and we perform the ritual of small talk that keeps our grief at manageable distances.

The house in Kamakura grows colder each year. Not the physical structure—I have had the heating improved, the windows sealed—but something in its bones resists warmth now that I am its sole inhabitant. My wife left nothing behind when she departed, not even the ghost of her presence. She was thorough in her erasure, as if she had never spent thirty years moving through these rooms, as if her absence could be as complete as her presence once seemed.

I understand now that she was always preparing for this departure, that every moment of our marriage was a kind of rehearsal for leaving. She would practice phrases in English—"I need space," "This isn't working," "We've grown apart"—importing the vocabulary of American self-help to describe the particularly Japanese tragedy of our mutual imprisonment. As if the problem were merely linguistic, as if finding the right words could transform the brutal fact of our incompatibility into something manageable, therapeutic, solved.

But some truths resist all translation. The way a marriage dies in silence, each partner retreating into private languages the other cannot access. The way a culture abandons itself, phrase by phrase, until even its poets write in the tongue of its conquerors. The way shame metastasizes in the space between what we feel and what we can say, growing more malignant with each failed attempt at expression.

My daughter tells me she is writing a paper on post-colonial affects in contemporary Asian literature. "Affect" —she uses the English word, though we are speaking Japanese now, and I hear how it sits uneasily in the sentence, a foreign object that cannot be metabolized. She is trying to theorize what I simply live: the condition of being perpetually out of place in one's own skin, of inhabiting a culture that exists now only in translation.

"Are you happy?" I ask her, and immediately regret the question. Happy—another word that translates poorly, carrying different obligations in each language. In English, it suggests a state to be achieved, a right to be pursued. In Japanese, it arrives shadowed by duty, by the quiet understanding that individual happiness is a luxury we can rarely afford.

She pauses. Through the phone line, across the Pacific, I can feel her searching for words in either language that might approximate truth.

"I'm published," she says finally. "My department values my work. My students respect me."

This is not an answer, but perhaps it is the only answer possible. We have learned to speak of our lives in terms of external validations, as if professional success could fill the spaces where meaning once resided. She does not say: I am lonely. She does not say: I wake each day to find myself a stranger in my own life. She does not need to. These truths pass between us in the silence that follows, in a frequency only we can hear.

After she hangs up, I walk through the house, touching objects that no longer seem to belong to me. The tea bowls my wife collected, each one perfectly imperfect in the way that once suggested profound aesthetic principles but now seems merely broken. The books in their floor-to-ceiling shelves, Japanese and English volumes pressed together like awkward strangers at a party, neither able to acknowledge the other's presence.

I think of my father, who spent his last years convinced that Japan had lost something essential in its embrace of the West. He would rail against the English words creeping into everyday speech, the McDonald's proliferating in ancient neighborhoods, the young people who could no longer write their own names in proper calligraphy. I thought him foolish then, a relic clinging to a past that had never been as pure as he imagined.

Now I understand he was mourning something more precise: the loss of a language adequate to our experience. Not Japanese versus English, but the possibility of any tongue that could articulate who we had become—neither Western nor Eastern, neither modern nor traditional, suspended in a permanent state of mistranslation.

My daughter sends me her paper when it is finished. I read it in my study, marking the places where her argument seems to strain against the academic English she has mastered, where I can sense her reaching for concepts that exist only in the spaces between languages. She writes about "the untranslatability of shame in the postcolonial subject," and I recognize in her theoretical framework the shape of our shared wound.

But she cannot write—the conventions of academic discourse will not permit her to write—about the particular texture of our shame. How it feels to apologize for existing in our own bodies. How we have internalized the gaze that finds us always insufficient—too Japanese for the West, too Western for Japan, too modern for tradition, too traditional for modernity. How we perform elaborate rituals of self-erasure, hoping to find in our own disappearance a kind of peace.

I want to tell her: You are writing about yourself. About me. About all of us who live in the aftermath of a cultural collision that has left us linguistic orphans. But I know she knows this too. The academic distance is its own form of protection, a way of approaching truths too painful to confront directly.

Instead, I write back: "Your argument is sophisticated and well-supported. I am proud of your achievements."

Even in my praise, I enact the very dynamic her paper describes—the retreat into formality when intimacy becomes unbearable, the use of English concepts ("sophisticated," "well-supported") to avoid the raw exposure of honest response. We are trapped, she and I, in the very patterns we can so clearly diagnose but cannot escape.

The cherry blossoms are blooming early this year, confused by the warming climate into premature display. I watch them from my window, thinking how their beauty has become commodified, packaged for tourist consumption, drained of the darker registers it once carried—the association with samurai culture, with beautiful death, with the exquisite sadness of impermanence.

Now they are merely pretty. Instagram-ready. Like everything else, they have been translated into a global language that strips them of specificity, renders them palatable for mass consumption. The tourists will come with their cameras, capturing images to prove they have experienced authentic Japan, not recognizing that what they photograph is already a translation, a performance of itself for foreign eyes.

My daughter calls again. She has met someone, she tells me. A colleague in the philosophy department, originally from Seoul, who understands "the situation." I hear the care with which she chooses this phrase, "the situation," as if our condition could be contained in such neutral terms.

"Does he make you laugh?" I ask, surprising myself with the question.

She pauses. "Yes," she says, and for the first time in our conversation, she sounds unguarded. "He makes terrible puns that work only if you know both Korean and English. They're untranslatable."

I smile, though she cannot see it. Perhaps this is a form of resistance—to find joy in the very failures of translation that otherwise define our limits. To make of our linguistic homelessness a kind of home.

But even as I think this, I know I am romanticizing. The truth is harder: we are damaged in ways that love cannot repair. We carry in our bodies the violence of cultural collision, the scars of trying to exist in languages that were never meant to hold us. Each generation inherits this damage and passes it on, slightly transformed but never healed.

My wife understood this, I think. It's why she left. Not for another man, as I first suspected, but for the promise of a life lived in a single language. She moved to California, where she could be simply and uncomplicatedly American, where her accented English marked her as interesting rather than incomplete. She sends occasional emails, brief and cordial, stripped of the ambiguity that once made our communication so fraught.

"I am well," she writes. "The weather here is always perfect."

I do not begrudge her this escape. We all find our ways of managing the unbearable. Some of us flee. Some of us theorize. Some of us sit in empty houses, writing in languages not our own, trying to capture truths that evaporate the moment we approach them.

My daughter's paper is published in a prestigious journal. She sends me the link, proud and embarrassed in equal measure. I read it again, noticing how the editorial process has smoothed away some of the rough edges where her argument strained against its linguistic constraints. The published version is more polished, more professional. It is also less true.

This is what we do, we who live between languages: we polish our truths until they shine with the dull gleam of acceptability. We learn to speak of our deepest wounds in the measured tones of academic discourse. We translate ourselves into versions that can circulate in the global marketplace of ideas, knowing that with each translation, something essential is lost.

But what choice do we have? To remain untranslated is to remain unheard. To speak only in our mother tongues is to accept a kind of isolation that modernity will not permit. So we continue, sentence by sentence, word by word, carrying the ache of the untranslatable in our bodies, hoping that somewhere in the space between languages, we might find a way to mean what we say.

The cherry blossoms are falling now, earlier than usual, carpeting the ground in pale pink. Tomorrow the street cleaners will come to sweep them away, restoring order to the chaos of beauty. But for now, in this moment suspended between blooming and erasure, they remain—like us, like all of us who live in translation—caught between one state and another, neither fully here nor fully gone, speaking in all languages and none.

My daughter calls one last time before the semester ends.

"Papa," she says, "I've been thinking about coming home for the summer."

Home. The word hangs between us, untranslatable as always, meaning too many things and not enough.

"You would be welcome," I say, knowing that welcome, too, is a word that carries different weights in different tongues, that what I offer and what she hears may not align.

But she understands, as I understand her. This is the only mercy granted to those who share the same untranslatable condition: the recognition that passes between us in the silence, in the space where all languages fail. We are, each of us, the other's only country now—a nation of two, speaking in a tongue that exists nowhere but in the frequency of our mutual understanding.

After she hangs up, I sit in the gathering dusk, watching the last petals fall. Somewhere between the Japanese I think in and the English I write in, between the life I lived and the life I narrate, there is a truth that refuses all capture. It is enough, perhaps, to know it exists. To feel its weight in the words I cannot say, in the languages that cannot hold me, in the silence that speaks more clearly than any tongue I have mastered or failed to master.

This is what we leave each other, we translators of our own existence: not words but the spaces between them, not meanings but the ache of meaning's absence, not home but the memory of what home might have been, in a language we never learned to speak.
