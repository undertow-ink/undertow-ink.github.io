Kieran Holloway - The Vanishing Horizon

The plains stretched before me, not as mere geography but as a temporal condition—a hauntology of space where the future we had been promised dissolves into an endless present. I had come here seeking something I could not name, drawn by reports of a phenomenon the locals called "the shimmer," though when pressed for details they would look away, their eyes tracking something invisible on the horizon.

In the cities, we had grown accustomed to the cancellation of the future. The same songs played in shopping centers that had played twenty years ago, remixed and remastered but never transcended. Here on the plains, time operated differently—not as nostalgia for lost futures but as an accumulation of presents, each moment containing all previous moments like Russian dolls of experience.

The landowners here practiced a peculiar form of documentation. They did not photograph or film; instead, they compiled what they called "inner archives"—mental repositories of moments that had never quite occurred but whose possibility haunted the actual. One elderly woman, whose property extended beyond the visible horizon, explained that she collected "pre-memories"—anticipations of events that the current cultural moment had made impossible.

"We used to dream of cities in the clouds," she said, gazing at the unchanging sky. "Now we can barely imagine tomorrow being different from today."

This was the crux of it: not that we had lost the ability to remember, but that we had lost the ability to forget in a way that would allow the genuinely new to emerge. The plains embodied this condition physically—their vastness suggested infinite possibility while their uniformity denied it. Every direction promised transformation; every journey ended where it began.

I thought of the music that no longer gets made, the albums that exist as spectralPresenceAbsence in the gaps between what was and what is. The plains had their own version of this—stories of settlements that had been planned but never built, whose non-existence somehow exerted more influence on the region than the actual towns. Maps showed them as dotted lines, provisional markings for futures that had been indefinitely postponed.

The shimmer, when I finally witnessed it, was exactly this: a visual manifestation of cancelled possibility. It appeared at noon, when the sun flattened all shadows and depth became negotiable. The horizon would appear to ripple, and for a moment you could see not what was there but what had been intended to be there—architectural blueprints suspended in heat haze, the ghosts of unbuilt worlds.

A young man who worked the eastern boundaries told me he had started collecting these visions, though he admitted the collection existed only in his mind. "You can't capture them," he said. "The moment you try to fix them in place, they become something else—nostalgia, perhaps, or mere fantasy. Their power lies in their refusal to be either memory or imagination."

This was the condition we all shared, whether on the plains or in the cities: caught between a past that had promised different futures and a present that could only recycle those failed promises. The culture industry had perfected this recycling, selling us back our own disappointed hopes as comfort food. But here, in this landscape that refused the consolation of landmarks, the condition revealed itself nakedly.

The landowners had developed a philosophy to match their geography. They spoke of "lateral time"—movement across the present rather than through it. They had given up on progress, that great modernist faith, but had not surrendered to stasis. Instead, they cultivated what they called "variations"—subtle differences in repetition that might, over vast stretches of time, amount to change.

I stayed for months, learning their ways. The discipline required was immense: to notice differences so slight they barely registered, to maintain hope without expectation, to archive experiences that hadn't quite happened while remaining alert to those that might. It was, I realized, a form of resistance—not against any specific force but against the very condition of the contemporary, which insisted that all times were now the same time.

The most unsettling discovery came near the end of my stay. I learned that many of the younger inhabitants had never left the plains, had never known any other relationship to time and possibility. For them, the shimmer was not a sign of cancelled futures but simply how the world revealed itself—uncertain, provisional, always about to become something it would never quite be.

One evening, as the sun set and the shimmer faded, I asked one of these young people what they hoped for.

"Hope?" she said, as if testing the word. "We don't hope. We attend."

This attendance—this patient watching for variations in the seemingly unchanging—struck me as both a surrender and a form of vigilance. They had accepted what we in the cities still struggled against: that the future as we had understood it was gone. But in accepting this, they had discovered something else, something I could only glimpse in the corners of my vision like the shimmer itself.

The plains taught me that hauntology was not just about being haunted by lost futures but about learning to live in their absence without despair. The real ghosts were not the unbuilt cities or the unmade music but ourselves—we who remembered when tomorrow was a promise rather than a threat.

When I finally left, driving back toward the coast and the cities of endless now, I carried with me not photographs or recordings but something more elusive: a sense of how to move laterally through time, how to notice the variations that might, accumulated over a lifetime, constitute a form of change indistinguishable from stillness yet utterly different from death.

The highway stretched before me, straight and featureless, a perfect metaphor for our condition. But I had learned to see the shimmer now, to catch those moments when the road revealed what it might have been, what it could never be, what it perpetually almost was. This was not consolation—it was method, a way of being in time when time itself had become a problem without a solution.

The plains receded in my mirrors, but they had already taken up residence in my inner archive, that collection of experiences that had happened without quite occurring, that catalog of presents that refused to become past. I understood now why the locals looked away when asked about the shimmer. It was not that they couldn't describe it but that description would fix it in place, would turn it from a living possibility into dead fact.

We are all residents of the plains now, whether we know it or not. The question is not how to escape—there is nowhere else to go—but how to inhabit this condition with something approaching grace. The landowners had shown me one way: patient attention to minimal variations, the cultivation of an inner life rich enough to sustain itself without external confirmation, the development of a memory that could remember forward as well as back.

As I drove through the night, the radio played songs I had heard a thousand times before, each repetition both exactly the same and subtly different. This was our fate and our opportunity: to live in the endless replay while remaining alert to those moments when the tape skipped, when the ghost of another song broke through, when the future we had lost made itself known not as promise but as presence—fleeting, uncertain, already disappearing, but undeniably there.
