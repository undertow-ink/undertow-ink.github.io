Daniel Wells - The Water That Left Us

"You keep asking for water," Detective Comeaux said, pushing the plastic cup closer to my side of the table. The ice had melted an hour ago, maybe two. Time moved different in that room, like honey poured over broken glass.

"Do I?" My voice sounded like it belonged to someone else, someone who lived in my throat but paid no rent.

"Fourth time. You ask, I give it to you, you stare at it like it might bite back."

The fluorescent light above us buzzed like a dying wasp. I knew that sound. Knew it from the parts store, from the inventory room where Vangie and I first—but no, that wasn't right. The sequence was all wrong. She came to the store looking for Marcus, but Marcus was at the track. Always at the track.

"Tell me about the night she disappeared," Comeaux said.

"Which night?" The words came out before I could stop them, and I saw her lean forward like a hound catching scent.

"You tell me, Beau. Which night matters?"

The water in the cup caught the light and threw it back broken. I thought about rivers changing course, how they could abandon a whole town without warning. Millfield used to have a port. Now we had a dry dock and a lot of empty buildings with their windows like dead eyes.

"She had these freckles," I said. "Across her shoulders. Like someone had flicked a paintbrush full of brown paint at her."

"Vangie had freckles."

"Looked like stars. Like constellations, if you knew how to read them."

Detective Comeaux wrote something in her notebook. The scratching of her pen reminded me of insects. Of nights by the water when the air was so thick with sound you could barely hear yourself think. That was where we went, Vangie and me. To the old boat launch where the river used to run before it decided we weren't worth the trouble.

"Marcus knew," I said.

"Knew what?"

"About us. About the meetings. He'd count the register twice when I came back from lunch, like maybe I'd been stealing more than time."

But that wasn't the stealing that worried Marcus. He had bigger concerns. The kind that wore expensive suits and collected debts with baseball bats. The kind that made a man sweat through his shirt even when the air conditioning was running full blast.

"You said meetings. How long were you and Vangie—"

"She wasn't like what you're thinking." The words came sharp, protective. "She wasn't some bored housewife looking for excitement. She was scared."

"Of Marcus?"

"Of what Marcus owed. Of who he owed it to."

The water in the cup hadn't moved, but somehow it looked different. Deeper. Like I could fall into it and keep falling until I hit bottom somewhere I'd never been but recognized anyway. Desert places. Sand that got into everything, even your dreams.

"There was this compound," I said.

Detective Comeaux's pen stopped moving. "What compound?"

"Nothing. Just—my mind wanders sometimes. Since the war."

"Which war, Beau?"

The question hung in the air like smoke. Like the smell of burning oil that clung to everything in the parts store. Like the perfume Vangie wore that was supposed to smell like jasmine but reminded me of something else. Something I couldn't quite place but knew I should remember.

"The one that mattered," I said.

The jasmine scent was strongest in the storeroom where we kept the belts and filters. She'd lean against the metal shelving and the fluorescent light would catch in her hair like water. But that's wrong too because hair doesn't hold light the way water does. Hair lets it go.

"Marcus thinks I don't know," she said that first afternoon when the heat outside made the asphalt soft and the air shimmer like lies. "About the money he owes. About what they'll do when they come collecting."

Her fingers traced patterns on the dusty shelf, writing words in a language I couldn't read. Or maybe I didn't want to. Reading meant understanding and understanding meant choosing, and I'd made enough choices to last several lifetimes.

"How much does he owe?"

"Enough to kill for. Enough to die for." She turned to face me and her eyes were the color of river water after a storm. "You ever been married, Beau?"

"Once. Long time ago."

"What happened?"

"I came back different than I left."

The storeroom smelled like motor oil and cardboard and something else underneath it all. Something organic and desperate, like an animal that knows it's trapped. She moved closer and I could see where her makeup didn't quite cover the bruise on her jaw. Yellow-green at the edges, purple-black in the center like a sunset viewed through dirty glass.

"Marcus do that?"

"Marcus doesn't have the balls to hit me. This came from his friends. A reminder about punctuality."

She was close enough now that I could feel the heat coming off her skin. Close enough to count the freckles if I wanted to. If I was the kind of man who counted things anymore.

"They hurt you to get to him."

"They hurt me because I'm convenient. Because women always are." Her hand found mine and her fingers were cold despite the heat. "You know about convenient, don't you? About being in the wrong place when someone needs to send a message?"

The compound rose up in my mind like a mirage. Adobe walls baked white by sun and something else. Dark stains that could have been rust or could have been evidence of how quickly convenient became permanent. There had been a woman there too. A translator who knew too many languages and not enough about staying invisible.

"I know about messages," I said.

Vangie's thumb moved across my knuckles and I felt something crack open inside my chest. Something that had been sealed shut since I came home to a country that looked familiar but felt foreign. Since I learned that some doors, once you walk through them, don't lead back to where you started.

"Meet me tonight," she whispered. "At the old boat launch. After Marcus falls asleep in front of the television."

"Vangie—"

"Don't think about it. Thinking's what gets people hurt."

But I was already thinking. About compounds and translators and the weight of choices that followed you home like stray dogs. About water that abandoned towns and women who disappeared into stories that made more sense than the truth.

She kissed me then, quick and desperate, and was gone before I could decide whether to pull away or pull her closer. The jasmine scent lingered in the storeroom like a promise or a threat.

Outside, the heat made everything waver at the edges, like the whole world was just a photograph left too long in the sun.

"You said there was a compound." Detective Comeaux's voice cut through the memory like a knife through gauze. "In the war."

I blinked and the storeroom dissolved, taking the jasmine with it. The interrogation room smelled like disinfectant and old coffee. Like places where truth went to die.

"Did I say that?"

"Few minutes ago. You mentioned a compound, then said your mind wanders."

The water cup sat between us like a challenge. Still full. Still untouched. My throat felt lined with sand but I couldn't make myself reach for it.

"Desert Storm," I said finally. "Supply convoy got turned around in a sandstorm. GPS was shit back then. We were supposed to be delivering MREs to a forward position but the storm lasted three days and when it cleared we were nowhere on any map."

"How's this connect to Vangie?"

"Maybe it doesn't. Maybe everything connects if you look at it sideways."

Detective Comeaux leaned back in her chair. She had patient eyes, the kind that had seen enough lies to recognize truth when it accidentally slipped out. "Try me."

"We found this place. Looked like it had been abandoned for weeks, maybe months. Concrete buildings with flat roofs. The kind of architecture that said someone had money once upon a time."

"Military installation?"

"Civilian. Maybe a farm cooperative, maybe something else. Hard to tell when half the buildings had been blown apart from the inside." I could taste dust just thinking about it. Desert dust that got into your teeth and stayed there. "There were bodies."

The fluorescent light buzzed and I was back there for a moment, squinting against sun that turned the sky white as bone. Sergeant Martinez kicking open doors while the rest of us tried to pretend we weren't scared of what we might find.

"Our people?"

"Locals. Men, women. Some had been shot, others..." I stopped. Some details didn't need sharing. Some images carved themselves too deep to dig out safely.

"Others what?"

"Tortured. Someone had taken their time, made it artistic. The kind of thing you do when information isn't the real goal."

Detective Comeaux wrote something down. Her handwriting was small and neat, like she was filing away pieces of me for later examination.

"You report this?"

"We radioed it in. Command told us to document what we could and move on. Said intelligence would handle it." I laughed but there wasn't any humor in it. "Intelligence. Like they could make sense of what we found in that last building."

"Which was?"

The water in the cup seemed to move even though I knew it couldn't. Seemed to ripple like something was swimming just beneath the surface.

"A woman. Alive. Iraqi, maybe twenty-five. She spoke English better than half my unit." 

"A survivor."

"That's what we thought at first. She was chained to a radiator in what used to be an office. Been there for days, maybe weeks. But she wasn't just another victim."

"What was she?"

I reached for the water cup without thinking, then stopped with my fingers an inch from the plastic. This close I could see my reflection in the surface, distorted and strange.

"She was the one who'd been asking the questions."

The boat launch looked different at night. What had been rotting wood and broken concrete in daylight became something softer in the darkness, like the moon was showing mercy. The water that wasn't there anymore left behind a basin of cattails and mud that smelled like secrets.

Vangie was already waiting when I arrived. She sat on the edge of the old dock with her feet dangling into nothing, smoking a cigarette that glowed like a firefly in the dark.

"You came," she said without turning around.

"You doubted I would?"

"I doubt everything these days. Keeps me alive."

I sat beside her and the dock creaked under our combined weight. Some night bird called from across the empty riverbed and another answered from somewhere behind us. A conversation in a language older than words.

"Tell me about your first husband," I said.

She took a long drag from her cigarette and held the smoke in her lungs like she was drowning on purpose. "What makes you think there was a first husband?"

"The way you talk about Marcus. Like he's a mistake you're still figuring out how to fix."

"Maybe he is." She flicked ash into the darkness and it disappeared like it had never existed. "Jimmy died in a hunting accident three years ago. Shotgun went off while he was climbing over a fence."

"Accidents happen."

"Do they?" She turned to look at me and her face was half shadow, half moonlight. "Jimmy had been hunting since he was eight years old. He knew better than to climb a fence with a loaded weapon."

The implications hung between us like spider webs. Invisible until you walked into them, then impossible to ignore.

"Insurance money?"

"Enough to start fresh somewhere else. But I met Marcus before I could leave, and Marcus had plans. Big plans that required capital and confidence." She laughed but it sounded like glass breaking. "I had the capital."

"And now he's gambled it away."

"Every last dollar. Plus interest that compounds daily and comes with penalty clauses that don't involve paperwork."

A breeze moved through the cattails and they whispered among themselves like old women sharing gossip. The sound reminded me of something I couldn't place. Something about wind through different grass in a different place where the air tasted like cordite and regret.

"Why Marcus? After losing one husband, why risk another?"

She was quiet for so long I thought she wasn't going to answer. When she finally spoke, her voice was softer than I'd ever heard it.

"You ever been so tired of being alone that you'd rather be miserable with someone than happy by yourself?"

"Yes."

"That's why Marcus. That's why I stayed even after I figured out what he was. What he'd never stop being." She took another drag from her cigarette. "But tired gets old too. And miserable starts feeling like a choice instead of fate."

"What are you saying?"

"I'm saying maybe it's time for another hunting accident."

The words settled over us like fog. Heavy and obscuring and impossible to see through clearly. I should have stood up. Should have walked away and pretended this conversation never happened. Should have remembered that some doors, once opened, led to places you couldn't come back from.

Instead I asked, "What do you need me to do?"

She smiled then, and in the moonlight her teeth looked sharp as promises.

"Just be somewhere else when it happens. And maybe forget we ever had this conversation."

But forgetting was never my strong suit. Remembering was the problem. Remembering was what followed you home and made sleep impossible and turned every innocent conversation into an interrogation with ghosts.

"She was the interrogator," Detective Comeaux said, like she was testing the weight of the words.

"That's what we figured. Files scattered around the room, most in Arabic but some in English. Questions about troop movements, supply routes. The kind of information that gets convoys blown up." I could still see those papers, some stained with things I didn't want to identify. "But here's the thing that didn't make sense."

"What's that?"

"She was chained up too. Like whoever had been running the operation decided she'd outlived her usefulness."

The interrogation room felt smaller than it had an hour ago. The walls seemed to be closing in by degrees, like a slow-motion trap. Detective Comeaux had taken off her jacket and I could see the outline of her service weapon under her shirt. A reminder that some conversations had consequences.

"What did you do with her?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" I finally picked up the water cup and held it without drinking. The plastic was warm from sitting under the fluorescent light. "Command said to secure any intelligence assets and await further orders."

"Assets."

"That's what they called her. Like she was equipment instead of a person." The water in the cup trembled and I realized my hands were shaking. "But looking at her, seeing what she'd been through, it was hard to think of her as the enemy."

"Even knowing what she'd done?"

"How do you know what anyone's done? How do you know why they did it?" The questions came out sharper than I intended. "Maybe she was a collaborator. Maybe she was just trying to survive. Maybe survival and collaboration look the same when you're desperate enough."

Detective Comeaux wrote something else in her notebook. Her pen made scratching sounds like insects moving through dead leaves.

"What were your orders?"

"Wait for extraction. Secure the site. Document everything." I set the water cup down harder than necessary and some slopped over the rim. "But extraction never came. Radio went dead the second day. We were alone out there with our asset and our questions and no good answers."

"How long?"

"Five days total. Long enough to learn she spoke four languages and had been a literature professor before the war. Long enough to find out she had a daughter in Baghdad who thought she was dead." The memory tasted like sand and moral compromise. "Long enough to realize that enemy and victim aren't always different categories."

"What happened on day five?"

The fluorescent light buzzed louder, like it was struggling to stay alive. Like it knew something I didn't want to face.

"Martinez wanted to leave her chained up. Said she was a terrorist and deserved whatever came next. Johnson thought we should turn her loose and let Allah sort it out." I could see their faces in the water cup's reflection, young and scared and trying to do right in a place where right had been redefined beyond recognition. "But I was squad leader. The choice was mine."

"What did you choose?"

"I chose to live with the consequences. Whatever they turned out to be."

Detective Comeaux looked up from her notebook. Her eyes were the color of river water after rain, dark and full of things that moved just beneath the surface.

"That's not an answer, Beau."

"It's the only answer I've got."

But that wasn't true. I had other answers. I had the answer that woke me up at three in the morning with my sheets soaked in sweat. The answer that made me understand why some secrets felt like poison in your bloodstream. The answer that explained why I recognized desperation when I saw it in Vangie's eyes.

I had the answer. I just couldn't say it out loud.

Not yet.

Marcus worked late on Thursdays. Inventory and books and the kind of accounting that made more sense after dark when honest people weren't watching. I knew this because we'd been partners for six years and because Vangie had mentioned it three times in the past week like she was memorizing a script.

The parts store felt different after hours. The fluorescent lights hummed lower and the shadows collected in corners like they were planning something. I was supposed to be at home watching television and establishing an alibi that would hold up under casual scrutiny. Instead I was sitting in my truck across the street, watching the yellow glow of Marcus's office window and trying to convince myself I was just curious.

The radio played country music from a station in Little Rock. Songs about women who left and men who stayed and the particular kind of heartbreak that came from understanding the difference too late. I turned it off but the silence was worse.

At 10:47 Marcus turned off his office light. I could see his silhouette moving through the store, probably setting the alarm and checking the locks. Habits that had kept him alive this long but wouldn't matter tonight if Vangie had meant what she said.

He came out the front door and stood for a moment under the security light, looking up and down the empty street like he was expecting trouble. Maybe he was. Maybe when you owed the kind of money Marcus owed, you learned to read danger in every shadow.

His car was parked in the alley behind the building. A ten-year-old Honda with a dent in the passenger door and a muffler that needed replacing. The kind of car that said its owner had fallen further than he'd ever expected to fall.

I waited until his taillights disappeared around the corner, then waited another five minutes because paranoia was a habit I'd never managed to break. The street stayed empty except for a cat that crossed from shadow to shadow like it knew something about staying invisible.

My phone rang at 11:23.

"It's done," Vangie said. Her voice sounded hollow, like she was speaking from the bottom of a well.

"What's done?"

"Don't make me say it. You know what's done."

A police siren wailed somewhere across town, faint and getting fainter. Could have been anything. Could have been nothing. Could have been the sound of choices becoming consequences.

"Where are you?"

"Home. Where I'm supposed to be. Where I've been all evening watching television and not answering the phone because I took two sleeping pills and went to bed early."

"Vangie—"

"Don't call me that anymore. Don't call me anything for a while." The line went quiet except for the sound of her breathing. Fast and shallow like she'd been running. "It wasn't supposed to feel like this."

"How was it supposed to feel?"

"Like relief. Like freedom. Like something other than this."

Another siren joined the first, and then another. The sound grew louder instead of fainter, which meant they were coming this way. Coming toward the parts store or somewhere close to it.

"I have to go," she said.

"Wait—"

But the line was already dead, leaving me alone with the radio static and the sound of sirens and the knowledge that some conversations marked the end of one story and the beginning of another.

I started my truck and drove home through streets that looked familiar but felt foreign, like I'd been gone longer than just a few hours. Like I'd crossed some invisible line and couldn't find my way back to the person I'd been before I decided to sit and watch and wait.

The sirens followed me all the way home, growing louder instead of softer, until they sounded like they were coming from inside my own head.

"You were there that night," Detective Comeaux said. It wasn't a question.

"I was home. Watching television."

"What were you watching?"

The question caught me off guard. Details were dangerous. Details were where lies went to die.

"Something on the History Channel. About World War Two."

"Specific episode?"

"I don't remember. They all blur together after a while." I reached for the water cup and this time I actually lifted it to my lips. The water tasted like chlorine and old pipes. Like municipal promises that had been broken so many times they'd stopped making them. "Why does it matter what I was watching?"

"Because Marcus Fell was shot twice in the chest at approximately 11:15 last Tuesday night. And because three witnesses saw a truck matching the description of yours parked across from the auto parts store between 10:30 and 11:30."

The water went down wrong and I coughed, spraying drops across the metal table between us. Detective Comeaux didn't flinch. She just waited while I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand.

"Lot of trucks in this town. Most of them look like mine."

"Blue Ford F-150, extended cab, primer spot on the passenger door where someone scraped a parking meter." She read from her notes like she was reciting scripture. "License plate ending in 847."

The fluorescent light above us stuttered and for a moment the room went dim. In that brief darkness I could see the compound again. Adobe walls and broken windows and the sound of Martinez arguing with Johnson about what constituted justice in a place where the rules had been suspended indefinitely.

"Maybe I went for a drive. Sometimes I do that when I can't sleep."

"Past the store where you work? Past the place where your business partner was about to be murdered?"

"I didn't know he was going to be murdered."

The words came out too fast, too defensive. Detective Comeaux's pen stopped moving and she looked up at me with eyes that had heard every variation of guilt trying to disguise itself as innocence.

"But you knew something was going to happen."

"I suspected Vangie was planning to leave him. Thought maybe she'd clean out their joint account and disappear. Figured Marcus might show up to work the next morning and find a Dear John letter on his desk."

"So you decided to watch."

"So I decided to drive around and think. And maybe I parked somewhere for a few minutes to clear my head."

"While your lover killed your business partner."

"While someone killed Marcus. Could have been anybody. Could have been the people he owed money to. Could have been a robbery gone wrong."

But we both knew it wasn't random. Robberies didn't happen in Millfield after ten o'clock because there wasn't anything left worth stealing. And the people Marcus owed money to were professionals who used baseball bats and tire irons, not guns that made noise and attracted attention.

"Tell me about the woman in Iraq," Detective Comeaux said, changing direction like a river finding a new channel.

"What about her?"

"You said you had to make a choice about her fate. What choice did you make?"

The water cup was empty now but I could still see my reflection in the bottom, distorted by the curved plastic. I looked older than I remembered, like the conversation had aged me in real time.

"I chose to do the right thing."

"Which was?"

"The right thing. The thing any decent person would have done in that situation."

"You keep saying that, but you won't say what it was."

Because saying it would make it real again. Because some truths were too heavy to carry and too dangerous to set down. Because the woman in the compound and Vangie at the boat launch were connected by more than just my memory, and admitting that connection would open doors I'd spent years trying to keep locked.

"I chose to live with the consequences," I said again.

Detective Comeaux closed her notebook and leaned back in her chair.

"Beau, I think it's time you told me where Vangie is."

The gun was smaller than I'd expected. A .38 revolver that looked like it had been bought at a pawn shop and never properly cleaned. Vangie held it like it weighed more than she could carry, her hands shaking so badly I was afraid it might go off by accident.

"I can't do this," she said.

We were standing in the alley behind the parts store. Marcus's Honda was parked twenty feet away under a security light that cast everything in harsh yellow shadows. He was supposed to come out the back door any minute, keys in hand, thinking about home and television and whatever small comforts waited for him there.

"Then don't," I said.

"You don't understand. They came to the house today. Marcus's friends. They said if he doesn't pay by Friday, they're going to start collecting interest in other ways." Her voice cracked like thin ice. "They described what they were going to do to me. In detail."

The alley smelled like garbage and motor oil and something else underneath it all. Fear, maybe. Or the particular stench of desperation when it started to rot.

"We could leave. Tonight. Drive to Little Rock, catch a bus to somewhere else."

"With what money? Marcus cleaned out our account to make a partial payment last week. I've got maybe three hundred dollars to my name."

"Then we call the police."

She laughed but there wasn't any humor in it. "And tell them what? That my husband owes money to dangerous people? That's called a civil matter, Beau. They don't get involved until after someone's already dead."

The back door of the parts store opened and Marcus stepped out, jingling his keys like a man without a care in the world. He looked smaller from a distance, more fragile. The kind of person who made bad decisions and then spent the rest of his life paying compound interest on them.

"Now," Vangie whispered.

But she didn't move. The gun stayed pointed at the ground while Marcus walked toward his car, whistling something under his breath. A country song about second chances and roads not taken.

"I can't," she said again.

Marcus reached his car and fumbled with his keys. The Honda's locks were manual and sticky, the kind that required patience and the right touch. He had his back to us, completely unaware that his life was being measured in seconds.

"Give me the gun," I said.

"What?"

"Give it to me. If it has to happen, let me do it."

She turned to look at me and her eyes were wide with something that might have been relief or might have been horror. "You don't understand what you're saying."

"I understand perfectly." And I did. I understood that some choices followed you forever, that some doors led to rooms you could never leave. I understood that I'd been in this exact position before, holding someone else's fate in my hands while the world waited to see what kind of man I really was.

"Beau—"

"I understand that there was no woman in the compound." The words came out steady and clear, like I'd been practicing them for years. "No interrogator chained to a radiator. No literature professor with a daughter in Baghdad."

Marcus got his car door open and the interior light came on, illuminating his face. He looked tired. Older than his years and worn down by the weight of obligations he couldn't meet.

"There was just us," I continued. "Just five American soldiers who found evidence of something we weren't supposed to see. Something our own people had done."

Vangie's hand found mine in the darkness.

"And I chose to keep quiet. Chose to let the dead stay buried and the guilty stay free because speaking up would have meant admitting I was the kind of person who could make that choice."

Marcus slammed his car door and the sound echoed off the alley walls like a gunshot. He started the engine and backed out toward the street, toward home, toward whatever small sanctuary waited for him there.

"But I am that kind of person," I said. "And so are you."

Vangie was crying now, silent tears that caught the security light like falling stars.

"So what do we do?"

"We do what people like us always do. We live with the consequences."

The Honda's taillights disappeared around the corner, taking Marcus with them. For now.

"She's dead, isn't she?" Detective Comeaux said.

The words hung in the fluorescent-lit air like smoke from a gun that had already been fired. I stared at the empty water cup and tried to remember when I'd finished drinking, but time had become elastic in this room. Unreliable.

"Why would you think that?"

"Because you keep talking about her in past tense. Because Marcus Fell was shot with a .38 that we found in the river three miles downstream from the old boat launch. Because when we dragged the river looking for the murder weapon, we found other things too."

My hands were steady now. Steadier than they'd been in years. Like finally approaching the truth had calmed something that had been thrashing around inside me since the night everything changed.

"What kind of things?"

"Clothing. A purse with identification. A wedding ring that matched the description Marcus gave us when he reported his wife missing three days before he was murdered."

The fluorescent light buzzed and I was back in the alley again, but it was different this time. Clearer. Less filtered through guilt and self-deception.

"He knew," I said.

"Knew what?"

"Marcus knew what we were planning. He'd been waiting for it. Preparing for it." The memory crystallized like water turning to ice. "When he came out that back door, he wasn't whistling. He was humming. The way people do when they're nervous but trying to seem calm."

Detective Comeaux leaned forward. "What happened in that alley, Beau?"

"We were there to kill him. Vangie and me. She had the gun and I had the justification and we both had the desperation that makes people do things they never thought they'd be capable of." I could see it now without the distortion of wishful thinking. "But when the moment came, neither of us could pull the trigger."

"So you let him go."

"So we thought we let him go. We stood there in the dark and watched him drive away and told ourselves we were better people than we'd thought. That we'd found our line and managed not to cross it."

"But that's not what happened."

"That's what I wanted to believe happened. What I needed to believe." The words came easier now, like water flowing downhill. "But Marcus was smarter than we gave him credit for. He knew Vangie was planning something. Had been planning it himself."

Detective Comeaux's pen moved across the page but I couldn't hear the scratching anymore. Everything had gone quiet except for the sound of my own voice finally telling the truth.

"He circled back. Parked at the other end of the alley and waited for us to leave. Then he followed Vangie home."

"And?"

"And they had a conversation. About loyalty and betrayal and what happens to people who try to solve their problems with violence." I could see Vangie's face in the water stain on the table, distorted but unmistakable. "Marcus had his own gun. Had been carrying it for weeks because of the people he owed money to."

"He killed her."

"He killed her and dumped her body in the river. Then he took her gun and waited three days before reporting her missing. Gave himself time to establish a pattern of concern, of a husband worried about his wife's unexplained absence."

"But someone killed Marcus too."

I nodded. "Someone did."

"Who?"

The fluorescent light flickered once and went steady. In that brief moment of uncertainty, I saw myself clearly for the first time in years. Not the man I wanted to be or the man I pretended to be, but the man I actually was.

"The same person who left that woman chained in the compound," I said. "The same person who chose silence over justice because justice was too complicated and silence was easier to live with."

Detective Comeaux set down her pen.

"The same person who's been trying to convince himself for twenty-three years that he's different from the people who make the hard choices."

"Beau—"

"But I'm not different. I never was. I just got better at lying to myself about it."

I stood up from the metal chair and it scraped against the floor like fingernails on a chalkboard. Detective Comeaux didn't try to stop me. Maybe she understood that some confessions had to come in their own time, in their own way.

"Where are you going?"

"To finish a conversation I should have finished a long time ago."

The door to the interrogation room wasn't locked. It never had been. I'd been free to leave whenever I wanted to.

I just hadn't wanted to badly enough.

Until now.

The old boat launch looked smaller in daylight. What the moon had made mysterious the sun revealed as ordinary decay. Rotting wood and cracked concrete and the kind of abandonment that happened so gradually you didn't notice it until everything useful was already gone.

Vangie was sitting on the edge of the dock just like she had that first night, her feet dangling into empty air where water used to be. But the illusion was thinner now, worn through by too much truth and not enough sleep.

"You came," she said without turning around.

"You doubted I would?"

"I doubted you existed. I doubted any of this existed." She turned and her face was exactly as I remembered it but somehow less real, like a photograph that had been handled too many times. "How long have you been having this conversation with yourself, Beau?"

The question settled over me like dust. Heavy and inevitable and impossible to brush away.

"Since the compound. Since I left that woman chained to the radiator because letting her go meant admitting what we'd found. What our own people had done to those villagers."

"And what did they do?"

"The same thing I did to Marcus. The same thing Marcus did to you. The same thing that happens when ordinary people decide they're tired of being victims and start looking for someone weaker to victimize instead."

A hawk circled overhead, riding thermals that rose from the sun-baked mud. Patient and predatory and completely indifferent to the small dramas playing out below.

"So there was no Vangie."

"There was. But she died in that alley when I decided I couldn't pull the trigger. When I chose to be the kind of man who lets other people make the hard choices." I sat down beside her and the dock creaked under my weight. "Marcus died three days later when I decided I was tired of being that kind of man."

"And the woman in Iraq?"

"Died when we left her there. When I chose to preserve my unit's reputation instead of doing what was right." The words tasted like sand and regret. "I killed her just as surely as if I'd pulled the trigger myself."

The wind moved through the cattails and they whispered secrets in a language I was finally ready to understand. Stories about choices and consequences and the particular weight of guilt when it calculates compound interest over decades.

"So what now?" she asked.

"Now I stop pretending you're someone else. Stop pretending I'm someone else." I could hear sirens in the distance, growing louder. Detective Comeaux had probably figured out where I'd gone. Had probably called for backup and roadblocks and all the machinery that activated when someone finally stopped running from themselves. "Now I face what I've always been."

"Which is?"

"A man who kills people when it's convenient. Who lets people die when it's easier. Who spends twenty-three years creating elaborate fantasies to avoid admitting what he's capable of."

Vangie smiled and for a moment she looked almost real. Almost like someone who could have existed outside my guilt and need for redemption.

"At least you finally know."

"Yeah. I finally know."

The sirens were close now, maybe a mile away and closing fast. Soon there would be questions and lawyers and a justice system designed to process men like me. Men who crossed lines and then spent years pretending the lines had never existed.

"Will you stay?" I asked.

"Do you need me to?"

I thought about it. Really thought about it for the first time in decades.

"No. I think I'm done needing you."

She nodded and stood up from the dock. Started walking away across the dried riverbed toward the line of trees on the far side. With each step she became more transparent, more obviously a construction of my own desperate imagination.

"Vangie," I called after her.

She stopped and turned back.

"I'm sorry. For all of it. For Marcus and the woman in the compound and everyone else who got caught in the blast radius of my choices."

"I know," she said. "That's why I existed in the first place."

Then she was gone, leaving me alone on the dock with the sound of approaching sirens and the weight of finally knowing who I really was. It felt lighter than I'd expected. Not good, but clean in a way I'd forgotten was possible.

I sat by the water that wasn't there anymore and waited for Detective Comeaux to find me. Waited to begin the long process of paying for choices I'd been making all my life.

The sun climbed higher and the sirens grew louder and somewhere in the distance a train whistle called across empty fields, carrying its own cargo of guilt and consequence toward destinations that remained mercifully unknown.
