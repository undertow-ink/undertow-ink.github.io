Kamilah Okonkwo - The Commons We Build

The problem isn't that we lack solutions. The problem is that every solution we create gets swallowed by the same machinery that created the problem in the first place.

Consider the community garden that sprouted in the abandoned lot on Crenshaw Boulevard. For three years, it fed families, taught children where food came from, created bonds between neighbors who'd lived side by side for decades without speaking. Then the city council—populated by representatives who'd never set foot in the neighborhood except during campaign season—voted to sell the land to a developer. The garden's most vocal defenders? They were invited to join a "Community Stakeholder Advisory Board" where they could provide "input" on the luxury condos that would replace their lettuce and tomatoes.

This is how capture works: it doesn't always crush alternatives. Sometimes it recruits them.

But here's what the council didn't expect. The gardeners had learned something in those three years of working the soil together. They'd discovered that the fantasy of individual property ownership—that foundational myth that says you need exclusive control over something to care for it—was exactly that: a fantasy. They'd been practicing a different way of being together, where your contribution earned you membership, not ownership. Where the point wasn't to extract value but to create it, together, for everyone.

So when the bulldozers came, the gardeners didn't just chain themselves to the fence. They did something more radical: they started again. And again. And again.

Every vacant lot became a potential commons. Every foreclosed home, a possible collective. They weren't trying to reform the system that had failed them. They were building around it, under it, through its cracks. They were demonstrating, with every seed planted and every meal shared, that the current arrangement wasn't inevitable—it was just one possibility among many.

The city's response was predictable. First came the citations for "illegal gardening." Then the arrests for "trespassing" on lots that had sat empty for years. The media painted them as radicals, anarchists, threats to the social order. But the gardeners kept planting. Because they understood something fundamental: the people who claim to speak for communities rarely come from them. The solutions designed in boardrooms and think tanks rarely address the problems people actually face.

This is the heart of elite capture: it's not just that elites hoard resources. It's that they hoard the very ability to define what counts as a problem and what counts as a solution. They transform every cry for justice into a "policy issue" requiring "expert input" and "stakeholder engagement"—always ensuring that the stakeholders who matter most are the ones with the deepest pockets.

But movements like the garden collective reveal capture's greatest weakness: it depends on our participation. It needs us to believe that change only comes from above, that we must wait for permission to build the world we need.

The gardeners refused to wait. They understood that every moment spent petitioning authorities for permission was a moment not spent creating alternatives. They grasped that real change doesn't come from changing who sits in the seats of power—it comes from making those seats irrelevant.

This isn't about dropping out or running away. It's about building new systems while the old ones still surround us. It's about creating spaces where different values can take root—where cooperation trumps competition, where contribution matters more than ownership, where no one gets to capture the collective effort for individual gain.

The technical term for this is "prefigurative politics"—living the change you want to see. But the gardeners just called it common sense. Why would you organize your revolutionary movement using the same hierarchical structures you're trying to overthrow? Why would you accept that some people's voices matter more than others when building a world where everyone matters?

The challenge is that capture adapts. When the city couldn't stop the gardens from spreading, they tried a different approach. They offered grants, created "urban agriculture zones," established bureaucratic processes for "community gardens." They tried to transform a radical act of commoning into a program to be administered. Some gardens took the money, got tangled in the reporting requirements, found themselves spending more time in meetings than in soil.

But others remembered: the point was never just to garden. It was to demonstrate that people could meet their own needs without permission, without oversight, without someone else defining the terms. Every captured garden taught the same lesson: stay nimble, stay autonomous, keep building.

This is where the intersection of ideas becomes crucial. Elite capture theory shows us how movements get co-opted, how revolutionary energy gets channeled into reformist dead ends. But understanding the mechanism isn't enough—we need to imagine and build alternatives that can resist capture while still growing and spreading.

The solution isn't to create more inclusive elites or more responsive institutions. It's to build systems that don't concentrate power in the first place. Where there's no center to capture, no hierarchy to climb, no gateway to guard. Where power flows from contribution and participation, not position and wealth.

The gardeners learned this through practice, not theory. They discovered that when you share tools, no one person can hoard them. When you share knowledge, it multiplies rather than diminishes. When you share labor, everyone becomes essential and no one becomes indispensable. These weren't abstract principles—they were survival strategies that emerged from the daily work of keeping each other fed.

But perhaps most importantly, they learned that building alternatives isn't about purity or perfection. Every garden made compromises, bent rules, worked with what they had. The point wasn't to create a perfect bubble outside the system—it was to create spaces where different relationships could form, where people could practice being human in ways the current system doesn't allow.

This is the paradox of transformation: you have to build the new world with the tools and materials of the old one. You have to organize people who've been shaped by competition to practice cooperation. You have to create abundance in a system designed around scarcity. You have to resist capture while engaging with the very structures that would capture you.

The gardeners' answer was elegant: diversity and redundancy. No single garden, no matter how successful, could transform the city. But a thousand gardens, each operating slightly differently, each experimenting with different approaches, each connected but autonomous—that was harder to stop. When one fell to development or bureaucracy, others learned from its fate. When one discovered a particularly effective technique, others adapted it to their own contexts.

This is how we build the commons we need: not through grand plans or revolutionary moments, but through the patient work of creating alternatives and defending them. Through the daily practice of different values. Through the stubborn insistence that the current arrangement is neither natural nor permanent.

The community gardens of Crenshaw Boulevard were never just about vegetables. They were about proving that we don't need permission to care for each other. That we don't need ownership to be responsible. That we don't need elites to tell us what our communities need.

Every seed planted was a vote for a different future. Every harvest shared was a rejection of artificial scarcity. Every meeting where everyone's voice mattered equally was a glimpse of what democracy could actually look like.

The gardens are still growing. The capture attempts continue. But something has shifted in the imagination of the neighborhood. People have tasted what it feels like to work for something together, to create value that can't be extracted or sold or hoarded. They've experienced, however briefly, what it means to be citizens rather than consumers, participants rather than spectators, creators rather than supplicants.

This is how the future arrives: not all at once, but garden by garden, experiment by experiment, connection by connection. It's already here, growing in the spaces the current system has abandoned or overlooked. Our job isn't to wait for it or vote for it or petition for it. Our job is to nurture it, protect it, and spread it.

Because the elite can only capture what we build for them. When we build for each other, with each other, something different becomes possible. Something that doesn't fit in their spreadsheets or respond to their incentives. Something that grows wild and fast and free, like weeds through concrete, like hope in dark times, like communities that refuse to be captured.

The question isn't whether another world is possible. The gardeners have already proven it is. The question is whether we'll join them in building it.
