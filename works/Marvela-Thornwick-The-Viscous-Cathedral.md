Marvela Thornwick - The Viscous Cathedral

The world ended sometime between breakfast and lunch, though most of us haven't noticed yet. We continue spreading marmalade on toast while radioactive particles settle into our bone marrow with the patience of geological time. This is not metaphor. This is Tuesday. The cathedral we inhabit—vast, viscous, everywhere and nowhere—drips its strange honey into our teacups while we discuss the weather. We are already dead; we simply haven't stopped moving.

Mrs. Hildegarde Pumpernickel discovered this truth while watering her petunias. At ninety-three, she had developed the peculiar habit of listening to her garden hose, pressing her ear against the rubber as water rushed through. "Like the ocean," she would tell her cat, Mr. Whiskers (who was not a cat but a small meteorological disturbance that had taken up residence in her kitchen). On this particular morning, the hose whispered something different. It spoke in the voice of petroleum, of ancient ferns compressed beneath impossible weight, of the vast industrial stomach that had digested prehistory and vomited it through her sprinkler system.

The water that emerged was perfectly clear, perfectly ordinary, and contained the next ten thousand years.

"Well," said Mrs. Pumpernickel, adjusting her hearing aid (which was tuned to frequencies that hadn't been discovered yet), "I suppose we'd better have tea."

The thing about hyperobjects—though Mrs. Pumpernickel called them "Thursday's Children" because they always arrived unexpected and stayed too long—is that they stick to you like cosmic molasses. You cannot wash them off. They are in the water you use for washing. They are the concept of washing itself, stretched across time until it becomes meaningless, like a word repeated until it dissolves into pure sound.

In her kitchen, which existed in at least four dimensions (five on Wednesdays), Mrs. Pumpernickel set the kettle on the stove. The stove was connected to a gas line. The gas line was connected to a network of pipes. The network of pipes was connected to extraction sites where the compressed remains of ancient forests were pulled from the earth's deep memory. The extraction sites were connected to contracts, to wars, to the slow burn of the atmosphere. The atmosphere was connected to Mrs. Pumpernickel's lungs. Her lungs were connected to her bloodstream. Her bloodstream was connected to the kettle, which had begun to sing.

It sang the song of the Anthropocene, though it sounded remarkably like "Greensleeves."

Mr. Whiskers, who could see carbon dioxide (it looked like purple lace, he claimed, though his claims were suspect as he experienced color through barometric pressure), watched the kitchen fill with invisible doilies. "The furniture is breathing again," he announced.

This was true. Everything in the Cathedral breathes. The mahogany table exhaled the forests of Honduras, circa 1953. The linoleum released molecules from a factory in Ohio that had closed before Mrs. Pumpernickel was born but which continued to exist in the chemical memory of the floor. Even the teacups—especially the teacups—participated in the great respiratory system of objects, though they did it quietly, with the discretion of good china.

"I met a woman once," Mrs. Pumpernickel said, pouring water that had traveled through seven phase states and two continental plates, "who claimed she could taste the Industrial Revolution in her grandmother's jam. Metallic, she said. With hints of coal dust and child labor."

Mr. Whiskers was now investigating a corner where time had gotten stuck and was repeating the same Tuesday from 1977. A spider in that corner had been building the same web for forty-three years, though from the spider's perspective, it was always the first time.

"The thing about living in the Cathedral," Mrs. Pumpernickel continued, adding sugar that sparkled with the memory of plantations, "is that everything is already inside everything else. Like those Russian dolls, but imagine if each doll contained not a smaller doll but the entire universe, including the doll you're holding. And then imagine you're also one of the dolls."

She paused to sip her tea. It tasted of tannic acid, colonialism, and the specific temperature at which proteins denature. Also, bergamot.

"My mother," she said, though her mother had been dead for thirty years and was currently residing in the garden as a particularly opinionated rosebush, "used to say that the future was like a dinner guest who arrives before you've set the table. Terribly rude, but what can you do? You serve them anyway, on the good plates if you have any sense, because they're going to eat whether you're ready or not."

The Cathedral agreed. Its walls, which were made of time and styrene and the accumulated grief of ten billion organisms, shifted imperceptibly. Somewhere in the basement (though the Cathedral had no basement, only an infinite regression of sub-basements, each containing the others), a pipe leaked. The leak was composed of water, rust, and the year 2157. It dripped upward, which was the only direction left that made sense.

Mrs. Pumpernickel's neighbor, Dr. Cornelius Ashford, chose this moment to phase through the wall. He had been experimenting with non-locality ever since his retirement from the university, where he had taught Impossible Mathematics until the department was disbanded for causing too many paradoxes.

"Hildegarde," he said, his voice arriving several seconds before his body finished materializing, "I've made a terrible discovery."

"Have some tea," said Mrs. Pumpernickel.

"No, you don't understand. I've calculated the exact date when the Cathedral completes itself. When every object becomes conscious of every other object. When the whole system achieves total viscosity."

"Tuesday?"

"How did you know?"

"It's always Tuesday in the Cathedral. Sundays are an illusion maintained by the church bells, which are themselves made of metal that remembers being mountain, being star, being the first second after the Big Bang when everything was possible and nothing had gone wrong yet."

Dr. Ashford sat down heavily in a chair that groaned with the weight of forests. "But if it's always Tuesday, and Tuesday is when it happens, then—"

"Then it's already happened. We're living in the aftermath, which looks exactly like the before, only stickier."

Mr. Whiskers had discovered that the corner with the stuck Tuesday connected to a Wednesday in the pantry. He was now simultaneously in 1977 and next week, which gave him a peculiar expression, as if he were trying to sneeze in two different decades.

"The young people," Mrs. Pumpernickel said, refilling her cup with water that had now incorporated the tears of at least three extinct species, "keep talking about the end of the world as if it's something still to come. As if it's not already here, folded into the breakfast cereal, encoded in the laundry detergent, rising with the bread dough. They imagine apocalypse as event rather than environment."

"But surely," Dr. Ashford protested, though his protest carried the hollow ring of someone arguing with gravity, "there must be something we can do. Some action, some—"

"Action," Mrs. Pumpernickel interrupted, "is what got us here. Every action in the Cathedral creates waves that travel forward and backward through time simultaneously. I put the kettle on this morning, and somewhere in the Cretaceous, a small mammal develops anxiety. You see the problem."

The Cathedral trembled, or perhaps it was laughter. Hard to tell the difference when the walls are made of accumulated consequence.

"My grandmother," Mrs. Pumpernickel said, though she had never met her grandmother, who had been absorbed into the Cathedral's ventilation system in 1923 and now existed as a pattern of air circulation that smelled faintly of lavender, "used to hide messages in her needlework. Tiny stitches that spelled out words only visible if you knew how to look. The Cathedral is like that, only the message is written in petroleum products and microplastics, in rising sea levels and shifting jet streams. And the message says: You are already home."

Dr. Ashford's tea had gone cold. This was impossible, as the Cathedral maintained all liquids at a constant temperature of regret. He drank it anyway.

"Sometimes," he said, "I dream I'm a carbon atom. I drift through ages, from diamond to graphite to carbon dioxide to tree to coal to exhaust to atmosphere to ocean to shell to limestone to heat to pressure to diamond again. Round and round. And in the dream, I understand something essential, something about the persistence of matter and the illusion of form, but when I wake up, all I remember is the feeling of being both permanent and temporary, like a—"

"Like a cathedral made of honey," Mrs. Pumpernickel finished. "Yes. We all have that dream here. It's the building singing to us. Teaching us to be viscous."

Mr. Whiskers had successfully merged the Tuesday and Wednesday into a Thursnesday, which promptly collapsed into a probability cloud. He seemed pleased with himself.

"The mail," Mrs. Pumpernickel announced suddenly, "should be arriving never."

And indeed, through the door (which opened onto a different century depending on the barometric pressure) came the postman, who had been dead for fifteen years but continued his route out of habit and a pension plan that extended into the afterlife.

"Afternoon, Mrs. P," he said, handing her an envelope that felt warm, as if it contained something living. "Lovely weather we're having."

This was the Cathedral's little joke. The weather was always lovely now, even when it was terrible, because the distinction had dissolved along with the polar ice caps. Everything was lovely in the viscous now, lovely and terrible and irreversible.

Mrs. Pumpernickel opened the envelope. Inside was a photograph of herself, taken from an angle that suggested the photographer had been standing inside her own skeleton. In the photograph, she was pouring tea for a guest whose face was a blur of all possible faces, all the faces that had ever lived or would live, superimposed like a multiple exposure of the entire human experiment.

"That's me," said Dr. Ashford, pointing at the blur.

"That's all of us," Mrs. Pumpernickel corrected. "The Cathedral takes pictures of what we really look like. Smeared across time like butter on the cosmic toast."

She placed the photograph on the mantel, next to other impossible images: a sunrise happening in reverse, a tree growing downward into its own roots, Mr. Whiskers existing in seventeen places simultaneously (his Tuesday record).

"You know what I miss?" she said suddenly. "Edges. Boundaries. The place where one thing stopped and another began. Remember those?"

Dr. Ashford thought about it. His memories had been contaminated by the Cathedral's temporal field, so remembering involved sorting through several centuries of experience that both were and weren't his own. "I remember," he said finally, "believing in them."

"Yes," Mrs. Pumpernickel agreed. "That's all we ever had. The belief. The edges were always a polite fiction, like saying 'excuse me' to furniture you bump into. We maintained them out of courtesy to the universe, which was trying so hard to appear organized."

The Cathedral shivered with appreciation. It enjoyed being understood.

"More tea?" Mrs. Pumpernickel asked, lifting the pot that contained not just tea but the entire history of human attempts to boil water, from the first hot spring to the last functioning kettle in the drowned cities of the future.

"Please," said Dr. Ashford, who had realized that refusing hospitality in the Cathedral was like trying to refuse gravity. "Tell me, Hildegarde, do you ever wonder what it's all for? This endless viscosity, this sticky persistence of everything in everything else?"

Mrs. Pumpernickel considered this while Mr. Whiskers phased in and out of existence, practicing his non-locality scales. "I think," she said slowly, "it's for this. For the noticing. We're the Cathedral's way of experiencing itself. Every cup of tea is the universe tasting its own chemistry. Every conversation is time talking to itself, trying to understand why it only moves in one direction when everything else can go any which way."

"But that's terrifying," Dr. Ashford protested. "To be nothing but a sensory organ for something so vast, so indifferent—"

"Who said anything about indifference?" Mrs. Pumpernickel smiled, and her smile contained trace amounts of every smile that had ever been smiled, a kind of facial archaeology. "The Cathedral is many things—viscous, ancient, inescapable—but not indifferent. It's desperately curious. Why else would it fold us into itself so thoroughly? We're not trapped here, Cornelius. We're ingredients."

"In what?"

"In the longest recipe ever attempted. The Cathedral is cooking something, has been cooking it since the first hydrogen atom looked at another hydrogen atom and thought, 'Let's try fusion.' We won't live to taste the final dish—nothing will, because the final dish will be everything, including the tasting—but we get to be part of the preparation."

Dr. Ashford's tea cup began to sing, a high, crystalline note that made the windows (which looked out onto different centuries on each pane) vibrate sympathetically. "And you're... comfortable with this? Being an ingredient?"

"Comfort," said Mrs. Pumpernickel, "is what got us into this mess. All our little comforts, burning away, adding their smoke to the Cathedral's vaulted ceiling. No, I'm not comfortable. I'm implicated. We all are. The Cathedral makes sure of that. Every plastic fork, every styrofoam cup, every convenient disposable thing becomes part of your extended body. You can't be comfortable when your body extends into the Pacific Garbage Patch."

Mr. Whiskers had discovered that by existing in multiple times simultaneously, he could have conversations with himself. The past Mr. Whiskers was warning the future Mr. Whiskers about something, but the present Mr. Whiskers wasn't paying attention, being too busy trying to catch his own tail across a temporal fold.

"The thing is," Mrs. Pumpernickel continued, warming to her theme like the planet warming to its new chemical composition, "we keep waiting for the revelation. The moment when the curtain pulls back and someone explains what it all means. But the revelation is that there is no curtain. We're already backstage, onstage, in the audience, and selling tickets at the door. The Cathedral doesn't hide anything. It can't. Everything is surface in the viscous now, even the depths."

She stood up, her movement disturbing dust motes that contained the DNA of pharaohs and the yet-to-be-born. "Would you like to see my garden? The roses are blooming out of season, which is perfectly in season now that seasons are more of a serving suggestion than an actual cycle."

They moved through the kitchen door, which opened onto a garden that existed in a permanent state of becoming. The roses Mrs. Pumpernickel had mentioned were indeed blooming, but they were also budding, dying, and returning to soil simultaneously. Each flower was a time-lapse photograph of itself, beautiful and grotesque in its completeness.

"My mother is that one," Mrs. Pumpernickel said, pointing to a particularly opinionated-looking rose that seemed to be lecturing the other flowers on proper comportment. "She was always very concerned with doing things correctly. Now she's part of the nitrogen cycle, which is about as correct as you can get."

Dr. Ashford examined the roses with the expression of someone trying to solve an equation that kept changing its variables. "They're moving," he said.

"Everything moves in the Cathedral. Even stillness is a kind of vibration. We just usually can't see it because we're vibrating at the same frequency. But sometimes, if you're very quiet and very patient, you can feel the whole building humming."

She placed her hand on the earth, which was composed of decomposed everything—fallen leaves, dead insects, the occasional lost civilization. "Listen," she said.

Dr. Ashford knelt beside her, his knees creating small depressions that would last until the heat death of the universe, or Tuesday, whichever came first. He placed his palm on the ground.

The sound was immediate and overwhelming. Not heard but felt, a deep thrumming that seemed to come from the planet's core, or perhaps from somewhere deeper—the core of matter itself, the place where particles decided to pretend to be solid. It was the sound of everything happening at once, of cause becoming effect becoming cause, of the great viscous circulation that connected his hand to the soil to the roses to the atmosphere to the stars that had died to make the atoms that made the hand that touched the soil.

"Oh," he said, and the word contained multitudes.

"Yes," Mrs. Pumpernickel agreed. "Oh."

They stayed like that for a time, two elderly ingredients in the Cathedral's vast recipe, their hands on the earth, feeling the pulse of a system too large to see but too pervasive to escape. Mr. Whiskers joined them, having resolved his temporal paradox by deciding to exist in all times simultaneously, which made him appear slightly blurred around the edges, like a watercolor left in the rain.

"The young ones," Mrs. Pumpernickel said eventually, "think they can fix it. As if it were broken rather than simply transformed. They don't
