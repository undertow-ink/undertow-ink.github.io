Solange Mercier - The Shape of What Breaks

We are always building our lives inside other people's ruins. This is not metaphor but fact: every community that has ever existed has risen from the wreckage of what came before, and every person who has ever loved has done so knowing that love itself is a structure built on future grief. The question is not whether we will inherit destruction or create it—we will do both—but whether we can learn to see the beauty in this endless cycle of assembly and collapse, whether we can find God not in permanence but in the very fact of breaking.

I think of the tsunami survivors I met in Thailand, how they spoke of the wave not as a single event but as a presence that had entered their lives and remained there, invisible but constant, like a new organ they had grown. One woman, whose daughter had been torn from her arms by the water, told me she could feel the ocean's weight in her chest every morning when she woke. "It never leaves," she said, "but neither does she." Her daughter lived now in that pressure, in that daily reminder of what water can do. This is what catastrophe teaches us: that loss and presence can occupy the exact same space.

But we resist this teaching. We build our houses on fault lines and call it hope. We create elaborate systems—economic, political, spiritual—designed to convince us that tomorrow will resemble today, that our children will inherit a world recognizable as the one we knew. This is the most dangerous faith of all, more destructive than any fundamentalism: the belief that things will continue as they are.

Change is the only constant, yes, but not the gentle change of seasons or the predicable arc of a human life. The change that shapes us is volcanic, tectonic. It comes as drought that lasts a generation, as currency that becomes worthless overnight, as neighbors who turn against neighbors when the food runs out. It comes as laws that dissolve like sugar in rain, as police who become predators, as hospitals that close their doors. And it comes as ordinary people who discover, in extremity, what they are capable of—both monstrous and divine.

I watched this discovery in the faces of the magistrates I profiled, those servants of a justice system they knew was imperfect but which they served anyway, with a dedication that bordered on the religious. One judge, who spent her days adjudicating the petty bankruptcies of the poor, told me that she saw her work as a kind of prayer. "Each case is a life falling apart," she said. "My job is to be present at the collapse, to make it official, to say: yes, this happened, this was real, this mattered." She understood that the law, like love, is not about preventing catastrophe but about creating meaning from it.

This is what we refuse to see: that meaning itself is an emergency response. We tell stories not because they change what happened but because they are all we have against the dark. Every philosophy, every religion, every work of art is a shelter built from the materials at hand, designed to last only until the next storm. And when that storm comes—and it will come—we will build again, with whatever remains.

In the drought-stricken valleys of California, I met communities who had learned this lesson in their bones. They spoke not of hope—that passive, dangerous emotion—but of readiness. They stored water in underground cisterns, grew food in hidden gardens, created networks of trust that operated outside any government system. They were not pessimists; they were realists who understood that love means preparing for the worst while working for the better. One woman, who ran a school for children whose parents had fled north, said: "We teach them reading and writing, yes, but also how to purify water, how to grow food in bad soil, how to set a broken bone. We teach them that knowledge and kindness are the only things you can carry when you run."

This is the paradox we must embrace: we are always running and always building, always losing and always finding new forms of love. The tsunami taught us that a wave can erase a coastline in minutes. The droughts teach us that absence can be as devastating as presence. The slow collapse of our institutions teaches us that nothing we trust is trustworthy except the human capacity to create trust again, in new forms, among new people, for new reasons.

But here is what I learned from both the survivors and the preppers, the judges and the teachers, the grieving and the vigilant: there is a strange joy in accepting catastrophe as the ground of being. Not a bitter joy, not resignation, but something more like what mystics describe—a sense of being precisely where you are meant to be, doing precisely what you are meant to do, even when that place is a ruin and that task is impossible.

The mother who lost her daughter to the wave now runs a school for orphans. She teaches them to swim. "The ocean took her," she says, "so I give children back to the ocean, but prepared." This is not healing—nothing heals from loss like that—but transformation. She has made her grief into something useful, her catastrophe into a kind of expertise.

We are all going to need that expertise. The wave is coming for all of us, in one form or another. It may be water or fire, economic collapse or social dissolution, disease or war or simply the slow grind of systems failing, one by one, like lights going out in a city at dusk. We can spend our energy pretending otherwise, or we can learn from those who have already been broken, who have already discovered that on the other side of catastrophe is not nothing but something new, something that could not have existed without the breaking.

This is not comfort. I am not here to comfort you. I am here to say that we are living in a time of endings, and that all times are times of endings, and that the only meaningful response is to become students of ending, to learn its patterns and its possibilities, to make ourselves ready not for survival—survival is a given, until it isn't—but for transformation.

The judge was right: our job is to be present at the collapse, to make it official, to say: yes, this happened, this was real, this mattered. But our job is also to imagine what comes next, to plant seeds in the ashes, to teach our children not just how to endure catastrophe but how to make it generative.

We are all tsunami survivors now, whether we know it or not. The wave has already hit; we are living in its aftermath, in that strange suspended moment when the water has receded but the world has not yet reformed itself. This is the most dangerous time and the most precious—when anything might be built, when all the old rules have been washed away, when we must decide what to salvage and what to let go.

I think of the woman counting rosary beads in the refugee camp, each bead a name of someone lost. I think of the teacher showing children how to test soil for contamination. I think of the neighbors sharing the last of their water, knowing it might not rain again for months. These are the saints of our time, the ones who understand that holiness is not about belief but about practice, not about faith in rescue but about the daily work of making life possible for one more day.

This is what both the mystics and the scientists know: we are all connected, not by love or intention but by consequence. The drought that empties one aquifer fills another with refugees. The factory that closes in one town opens a food bank in the next. We are always living in each other's ruins, always building with each other's wreckage. The only choice is whether we do it consciously, with intention and skill, or whether we pretend we are separate, pretend we are safe, pretend the wave will never reach our shore.

It has already reached our shore. We are already drowning or learning to swim. The question is whether we will teach others what we learn, whether we will make our survival useful, whether we will acknowledge that catastrophe is not the exception but the rule, not the ending but the beginning, not the enemy of meaning but its source.

This is the shape of what breaks: it breaks in patterns, along lines of weakness that were always there. It breaks predictably, for those who know how to read the signs. And it breaks us open, if we let it, to new ways of being human, new definitions of strength, new forms of love that do not depend on permanence or safety but on the simple fact of continuing, together, in the face of what comes.

We are building our lives inside other people's ruins. We are leaving ruins for others to build in. This is not tragedy but simply the way things are, have always been, will always be. The only question is what kind of ruins we leave, what kind of building we do, what kind of beauty we can make from breaking.
