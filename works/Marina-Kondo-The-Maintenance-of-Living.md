Marina Kondo - The Maintenance of Living

The factory where I sort invoices sits beside a motorway. Every morning, I watch the cars stream past like metal fish, each one carrying someone to their particular version of nowhere. I have been working here for three months, though it feels both longer and shorter than that. Time moves differently when you spend eight hours a day matching purchase orders to delivery notes, checking that what was promised was what arrived.

My desk faces a window that overlooks the car park. Beyond that, there's a field where nothing grows except the kind of grass that survives neglect. Sometimes I see a woman walking there during lunch break. She moves with the deliberate slowness of someone who has nowhere urgent to be, or perhaps someone who has decided that urgency itself is a kind of trap. I recognize something in her gait – the careful placement of each foot, as if she's writing a sentence across the earth that only she can read.

The other workers call this job "maintenance." We maintain the flow of paper, the accuracy of numbers, the illusion that everything ordered will arrive exactly as specified. But I've come to understand that what we're really maintaining is something else entirely – the structure that keeps us here, filing and checking, checking and filing, while life pools around our ankles like water we're too busy to notice rising.

Yesterday, my supervisor asked if I was happy. She stood beside my desk holding a clipboard, her smile as precisely calibrated as the margins on our invoice forms. "Happy enough," I told her, which seemed to satisfy whatever box she needed to tick. But last night I dreamed I was swimming through an ocean of carbon copies, each one documenting a transaction I couldn't quite remember making.

My grandmother used to say that work was dignity. She scrubbed floors in an office building for forty years, her knees gradually reshaping themselves to accommodate the posture of perpetual genuflection. When she died, they found her savings hidden in coffee tins throughout her apartment – money she never spent because spending felt too much like admitting the floors had won.

The factory makes components for things that make other things. This is as specific as anyone can be about our purpose. Sometimes I imagine all the factories in all the world, each making pieces of puzzles no one person can see completely, and I wonder if this is what we mean when we talk about modern life – this vast, interconnected incomprehension, this collaborative mystification.

During break, I sit in the cafeteria and eat the lunch I packed at 6 AM, when my kitchen was still dark and my movements were automatic, learned through repetition rather than consciousness. The fluorescent lights hum above us like mechanical prayers. A man at the next table tells his colleague about his daughter's school play. She was a tree, he says, and she had to stand very still for a very long time. "She was brilliant at it," he adds, and something in his voice suggests he understands the profound accomplishment of stillness in a world that demands constant motion.

I think about mentioning the woman in the field, how her walking seems like the opposite of standing still – movement that goes nowhere but means everything. But I keep quiet and return to my desk, where seventy-three invoices await reconciliation.

The truth is, I chose this job. After my divorce, I needed something that would pay rent on a small apartment where I could finally arrange my books the way I wanted, where I could wake at 3 AM and make tea without explaining myself to anyone. The factory offered regularity, predictability, a steady accumulation of days that might eventually add up to a life.

But lately, I've been thinking about maintenance differently. What if what needs maintaining isn't the system but the secret self that persists despite it? The self that notices the woman in the field, that dreams of swimming through paper seas, that recognizes freedom in the careful arrangement of books on a shelf?

Last week, I found an error in an invoice from 2019. The wrong quantity had been entered, but the error had been carried forward through every subsequent transaction, compounding itself until it became a kind of truth. I stared at it for a long time, this small mistake that had been officially verified hundreds of times, wondering if this was a metaphor or just a clerical error.

I corrected it, of course. That's what I'm paid to do. But I also made a copy for myself, which I keep in my desk drawer like a talisman. Evidence that even in systems designed for perfect reproduction, variation creeps in. Proof that maintenance might also mean preserving the possibility of deviation.

The woman in the field is out there again today. From my window, I watch her pause and look up at the factory, shading her eyes against the afternoon sun. For a moment, I imagine she can see me here at my desk, imagine she understands that I am both the prisoner and the guard, the invoice and the error, the still tree and the moving woman, all at once.

The phone rings. There's a discrepancy in last month's orders that needs investigating. I answer with my name and department, my voice carrying the professional neutrality we're trained to maintain. But even as I speak, I'm thinking about what it means to maintain a life – not just to preserve it, but to claim it, error by error, step by step, one careful deviation at a time.

The factory hums on around me, efficient and eternal. But through my window, the field waits, patient as paper, ready to receive whatever sentence I might finally be brave enough to write across it with my own searching feet.
